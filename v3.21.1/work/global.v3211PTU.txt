NEW	Headhunters_bounty_desc_001=The Headhunters recently loaned credits to ~mission(TargetName) under some clear conditions. Specifically, pay us back or we’ll kill you. Wild to think that wasn’t enough of an incentive, but here we are past the payment deadline. Now as much as we like ~mission(TargetName|First), I need you to make good on our promise.\n\n~mission(TargetName|Last) was last seen at ~mission(Location|Address).

Prepare accordingly. \n\nStows out.
NEW	Headhunters_bounty_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) borrowed a bunch of creds from the Headhunters and thought the smart move was to try and hide instead of paying us back, so I need someone to make an example of ~mission(TargetName|Last).\n\nThey were just spotted at ~mission(Location|Address), so I’d recommend heading there now before the trail goes cold. ~mission(TargetName|Last) is a paranoid sort, so don’t be surprised if they’re not alone.

Instead of sitting back and waiting for something to happen, we’ve decided to be proactive. \n\n~mission(TargetName|Last) was just spotted with others around ~mission(Location|Address).

NEW	Headhunters_bounty_xenothreat_desc_002=XenoThreat recently hit a Headhunters' stronghold. I’ll spare you the details, but they did some truly heinous shit to our crew. We’ve identified the leader of the op as ~mission(TargetName) and are looking for a little payback. We don’t care what you do to get the job done. Only that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is dead. \n\nA source just told us that you can track down this XenoThreat scum over at ~mission(Location|Address). This sicko’s a pro and never travels alone, so don’t expect taking them out to be a walk in the park.  \n\nStows out. 
NEW	Headhunters_bounty_xenothreat_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) was recently revealed to be a mole for XenoThreat. It all makes sense now because the skav was a major asshole. Unfortunately, they split before we could handle it ourselves. \n\nBased on all they learned about our ops, we need ‘em taken out pronto. They see one of us coming and they’ll just run again, but I figured someone like you has a better chance of getting close enough for a killshot. \n\nWe just got word ~mission(TargetName|Last) was hanging around ~mission(Location|Address). Looks like there’s other ships around protecting ‘em too. Think you got the skill to rid the ‘verse of a traitorous bastard and their bastard friends?  \n\nStows out.\n

That sound like something you’d be into?\n\nAs for the ship, you can do whatever you want with it, but if it spots you, don’t be surprised if it tries to go get some back up. That’s just how these things go.\n\nStows out.
NEW	Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_hard=Some idiots think they can blatantly spy on the Headhunters and get away with it. They’ve set up several orbital sentries at ~mission(location|address) and have a few ships patrolling the area. We don’t know who’s behind it but we honestly don’t care. We just need it gone. \n\nLet us know if you feel like putting some real brash bastards in their place. We’ll pay you well and deliver the creds the second the job is done. \n\nKeep in mind that it’s really only the sentries we care about. The ships they got patrolling are only a concern if they get in your way or if they try to call in some friends to stop you. \n \nStows out.

NEW	Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_medium=Headhunters are looking for a merc to do a little clean up for us. Found out that someone’s trying to spy on us over at ~mission(location|address). Can’t let that stand. We need a skilled operator to take care of the orbital sentries they dropped there, and if needed, deal with any of their ships that get in your way. Seems like a decently run op, so hitting it might not be easy but it sure should be fun. \n\nLet us know if you’re the right one for the gig. Creds will be transferred once our scans show it’s gone. \n\nStows out.
NEW	Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_rand=Headhunters recently discovered some orbital sentries focused on our operations and we don’t like it one bit. I’m looking to pay someone to go to ~mission(location|address) and make it abundantly clear they should stay the hell out of our business. Doubt they’ll be receptive to a discussion about it, so I’d be prepared to evict them with extreme force. \n\nBased on our scans, this won’t be a walk in the park. Wouldn’t be a bad idea to come prepared with plenty of ammo. Payment will be sent promptly once the job is done. \n\nStows out.

Figure the simplest solution is to hire you to head over to ~mission(location|address) and destroy the data servers Citizens for Pyro are storing the info on. \n\nBoom. No more problem.\n\nNow, my understanding is that the locals didn’t know what the servers are for, so if it were up to me I’d say keep the collateral damage to a minimum, but hell, if they try to stop you, do what you have to.\n\n-Stows\n

They could be good recruits for us, but their leader’s getting in the way.\n\nThe prick in charge is ~mission(targetname). Word is they’ve got no love for us and are making overtures to XenoThreat. That’s a problem. We’d like to hire you to take ‘em out and make space for someone else to lead them in a more acceptable direction.  \n\n~mission(Location|CaveSize) I’d prefer if you limited the collateral damage, but I won’t hold you to it. \n\n- Stows

We took what we want, so we’re selling the location to anyone who wants it. If that’s you, send us your credits and we’ll transfer the coordinates. They’ll remain in your map until you abandon the contract.\n\nThe faster you decide, the faster you get to start tearing apart these ships before the competition does.\n\nStows out.

Should be a decent payday depending on how many others decide to show.\n\nThere’s a chance that these nobodies might’ve had friends so I wouldn’t be surprised if some of their people started sniffin’ round. Handle ‘em quick and you should be fine. Just more to salvage, right?\n\n- Stows

Lots of ships went down near ~mission(location|address) and I got wind that those bastards are out there trying to recover their ships – and ours – so they can use the parts again or whatever those assholes do. All I know is I’d rather someone else clean ‘em out first.\n\nThat’s why I’m selling the coords to all any friends who want ‘em. Won’t even make it too expensive. Salvage as much as you can and whenever you’re satisfied, cancel the contract and call it a day.\n\nLast bit of advice – you might want to bring some back-up – these nutjobs field some serious firepower.\n\nStows out.

Seems only right that XenoThreat pay up for what they did.   \n\nI need someone to grab the ~mission(item) from ~mission(Pickup1|Address) and deliver it to ~mission(Dropoff1|Address).\n\nHighly doubt these assholes will let you get your hands on these crates without putting up a fight.

DIFF	Tut03_Part03_Journal01_TraversingtheVerse_Content=Congratulations!\n\nYou’ve completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the universe! \n\nNow it’s up to you decide what your life in space will be like. The Contract Manager on your mobiGlas contains many different opportunities for you to pursue from simple delivery missions to dangerous criminal jobs. Work hard and you can build your reputation with different organizations to gain access to more rewarding contracts. Whether you choose to live a life of crime or hunt down bounties and enforce the law, it is up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’d rather forge your own path, feel free to use the StarMap in the mobiGlas and explore all the Stanton system has to offer. From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. Wherever your next steps take you, safe flying!\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT\nIf you’re interested in practicing flying or experiencing combat without risking your ship, Star Citizen features an arcade mode called ‘Arena Commander’ as an option in the game’s main menu.\n\nMOBIGLAS\nYour mobiGlas personal computer features a variety of functions and apps essential to life in the ‘verse.  Below is a list of all the apps, listed in the order they appear, that are accessible via the icons at the bottom of your mobiGlas.\n\n_______________________________________\nMOBIGLASS APPS\n\nHome – Displays information about your personal status including your health and how many credits you have to your name.\n\nCommlink – Shows chat channels, friends, and pending invites to the party system. Create a party, invite other players, or send friend requests here. You can also activate or deactivate proximity-based voice chat from this app.\n\nVehicle Loadout Manager – Customized the loadout, including components or paints, for any vehicle you own that are stored at your current local location. Components you wish to use must be in your local inventory.\n\nNikNax – Locate any assets you have stored across the 'verse. Selecting an asset will provide added details.\n\nSkyline – Access the StarMap set Quantum Travel routes by selecting a location and pressing the “Set As Destination” button. \n\nmo.Trader – Send aUEC to any player. Party members will be pinned to the top of the selection list.\n\nContracts Manager – View, accept, and manage contracts. The Contracts Manager is divided into the following tabs: General, Personal, Accepted, and History.\n• The General Tab displays local contracts certified to meet UEE and local law requirements. \n• The Personal Tab displays contracts sent specifically to your account, often from unknown sources that may violate local laws.\n• Once you accept an offer, contracts are moved to the Accepted Tab, and once a contract ends, either through successful completion or by other means, a record of it is kept in the History Tab.\n\nVehicle Maintenance Services – Repair, restock, and refuel your vehicles.\n\nJournal – A record of useful information and documents, including tutorial information.\n\nDelphi – Track your reputation with individual organizations or contacts.

The four planets in the system are owned by megacorporations who each purchased a planet from the UEE and now govern their own region of space. They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\n~mission(Location|Name) is a luxurious domed city that serves as the corporate headquarters to microTech, the leading computer and software developer in the Empire best known for making the mobiGlas. From here, the tutorial will guide you to ~mission(Destination), the space station in orbit above the planet that can serve as your gateway to further exploration of the Stanton system.
DIFF	Tutorial02_MissionDesc=Well done!\n\nWith the first part behind you, you should now have some basic familiarity with the movement controls, managing your hunger and thirst, and some of the core functionality of your mobiGlas – namely the Contract Manager and your Journal.\n\nThis next section will help you familiarize yourself with ~mission(Location|Name) and take you to visit ~mission(StoreName), a weapons store here in ~mission(Location|Name).\n\nYou can shop there, and at other stores like it, using United Earth Credits (UEC). During the Alpha phase of Star Citizen’s development, we will be using a currency called aUEC (Alpha United Earth Credits). This is a temporary currency specifically designed for testing the in-game economy and balance.  
DIFF	Tutorial02_MissionTitle=Tutorial - Your First Outing
DIFF	Tutorial03_MissionDesc=You’re almost through with the tutorial. All that remains is to take flight!\n\nWith your business in ~mission(Location|Name) finished, it’s time to leave the city – and eventually the planet. Make your way to the ~mission(TransitNameShort) transit shuttles. These shuttles can take you all around ~mission(Location|Name) – but your destination is the spaceport, where an Anvil C8 Pisces has been temporarily provided for you.\n\nThis snub scouting ship is a great starter vessel, perfect for new pilots looking to get their wings.

NEW	XenoThreat_claimsweep_desc_easy=Our resistance movement is growing by the day, but that comes with some unwanted attention.  Recent scans discovered orbital sentries at ~mission(location|address) and a ship running a patrol pattern. We believe this is part of an espionage campaign targeting XenoThreat, most likely funded by the UEE. \n\nWe’re looking for an experienced merc willing to destroy the sentries ASAP.  Since they already have eyes and ears on us, sending in someone from outside the org would draw less attention. If you take the gig, you’ll be paid promptly once the sentries are destroyed.\n \nNow, while the patrol ship isn’t the main target, we suspect that if it escapes it might have reinforcements in reserve. Might be smart to deal with it promptly. \n\nIf you decide to help us, XenoThreat will remember you’re someone willing to fight for what’s right.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler
NEW	XenoThreat_claimsweep_desc_hard=Recent scans discovered several orbital sentries and ships at ~mission(location|address). We believe they’re part of an espionage campaign targeting XenoThreat, in response to our recent actions in the Stanton system. Seems XenoThreat must be doing something right, if they’re out here spying like this.\n\nWe’re looking for an experienced and highly-skilled merc willing to eliminate this operation. If you don’t want Pyro to become a surveillance system, then this is your chance to stop it. The sentries probably won’t be too big of an issue, but pay mind to the patrol ships. If they manage to break away, you’ll have a whole lot more trouble breathing down your neck. \n\nYou’ll have our gratitude and a sizable payment once the job is done. \n\nComm. Spec. Engler
NEW	XenoThreat_claimsweep_desc_intro=It seems our struggle to free Humanity has got the government lapdogs back on Earth feeling nervous. Recent scans discovered an orbital sentry at ~mission(location|address) that we believe is part of an UEE espionage campaign. Good credits says they’re handing the data direct to the slinks themselves. \n\nOnly one sentry has been detected so far, but who knows how big the operation will grow if it’s not taken off-line. Shouldn’t be too much trouble for a skilled merc. If that sounds like you, payment will be sent promptly once the sentry is destroyed. Plus, XenoThreat will remember that you’re someone willing to fight for what’s right.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler
NEW	XenoThreat_claimsweep_desc_medium=Do you value Humanity’s freedom? If so, I’m offering you a chance to prove it. Recent scans discovered orbital sentries and patrolling ships at ~mission(location|address). We believe they’re part of a UEE espionage campaign targeting XenoThreat. It’s important that we stop their intelligence gathering before we launch our next mission.\n\nWe’re looking for an experienced merc willing to eliminate these forces immediately. The sentries are the priority, but the ships might prove a bigger issue if they’re allowed to escape. You’ll have to evaluate the situation more closely once you’re on site. \n\nWe could take care of it ourselves, but want to send in a contractor so the scum behind it don’t know who hit them. Payment will be sent promptly upon completion. Plus, the satisfaction of knowing you’re helping a good cause.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler

We believe they’re part of a UEE espionage campaign targeting XenoThreat and it's vital that it be stopped before they gather anything that could harm our ongoing efforts.\n\nWe’re looking for a skilled merc willing to eliminate this threat and stop this invasion of privacy before it spreads even further. Who knows how much bigger this operation will get if it’s not taken off-line immediately? Payment will make it worth your while and be sent promptly once everything is blown to bits. \n\nSee it done, and help be a part of the right side of history.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler

That’s why we’ll pay you to raid ~mission(Pickup1|Address) and claim the ~mission(item) for the cause. Once you deliver everything to ~mission(Dropoff1|Address) we can redistribute the shipment to help in our fight.

We missed the chance to hit that shipment, but still want to send the message that working with aliens in any capacity will not be tolerated in this system. \n\nThat shipment was delivered to ~mission(Pickup1|Address).

And for this job, I'll be able keep track of their cybersecurity team remotely and flag any sabotaged servers for you to fix. Can't afford to lose too many. \n\nAs for the mainframe, they should have a way to access it on site, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to take a cryptokey in case you need to hack your way in. Usually, this kind of job requires a crew, but I figure you could probably solo this one and keep more of the creds for yourself. Don’t really care either way as long as it gets done.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c

Once my link is secure, I’m expecting you to keep things in order until I’ve pulled data from 4 of their servers. \n\nNow, I’m gonna be blind as far as any security goes, so you and whoever you bring will need to keep an eye on the servers yourself. We can lose a few of them, but any more than that and this job’ll be a bust.\n\nThe pay should be enough to cover you and the other person you convince to tag along.\n\nLet’s make it happen,\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
NEW	bitzeros_dataheist_desc_03=Got another job ready to pull the trigger on, though it might be a little tougher than usual. I need to rip 5 servers worth of data from ~mission(location|address).\n\nSame plan as usual. Find a way into the mainframe on site or hack your way in with a cryptokey, then make sure security doesn’t interfere with the servers while I pull the data. Now, unfortunately, I’m expecting them to be much more responsive than usual. If they catch wind of someone poking around, they might try to remotely take down their own servers to keep us from getting to them.\n\nMake sure to take a couple people you can trust with you, this won’t be the kind of job you can just wing on your own and I won’t be caught out just because you’re feeling cocky.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c

Make sure you’re ready to dig in because the transfer’s gonna take about 40 minutes, during which you’ll need to deal with their onsite and remote security trying to shut us down any way they can.\n\nYou should bring some friends too. I can’t see you pulling this off without at least 3 other people to help protect the upload.

Ripping that much data is gonna take at least 45 minutes, so make sure you’re geared up for a long one.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that their security’s going to throw everything they can to stop us and since we can’t afford to lose more than a couple servers, they’ve got the advantage.\n\nAs usual, this is an all or nothing kind of situation.

NEW	cfp_searchbody_danger_outpost_desc_001=Hey,\n\nUnfortunately, one of our community partners, ~mission(TargetName), has been missing for a few days. Their family contacted Citizens for Pyro for help and I told them we would do what we could. That said, with so much time passed, I’m not too hopeful. \n\nWhatever their current state is, I was hoping you could be our eyes on the ground for this one. There’s a strong chance that they were headed to ~mission(Location|Address), an area known to be very dangerous.\n\nIf you can track them down and confirm their status, one way or another, I’ll see that you’re properly compensated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro\n

They finished up a trade at ~mission(Location|Address) and haven’t been seen since. We’re hearing reports that outlaws have been sneaking aboard there, and if that’s true, I suspect that the worst might have happened.\n\nEither way, ~mission(TargetName|First) has done good work for us in the past and I’d hate for them to wind up as just another one of Pyro’s missing. If you’re willing to find them for me, I’ll see that you get a reward. \n\nJust be careful. Hate for you to go missing too.\n\nThanks,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro\n

Chances of survival at this point are pretty slim, but I still think its worth confirming what happened to them.\n \nI could use your help on this if you’re interested. And besides being a good deed, the payment should make it worth the effort. ~mission(Location|CaveSize)\n\nThanks,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro\n\n

If you head there now, there’s a good chance you can pick up their trail and take ‘em out for good. \n\n~mission(TargetName|Last) didn’t work alone, so don’t be surprised if they’re traveling with extra protection.\n\n- Smokey\n

NEW	roughready_claimsweep_desc_easy=The Rough & Ready crew is looking for someone to handle a delicate situation. We’ve discovered a ship and orbital sentries at ~mission(location|address) spyin’ on us. We’re in a bit of a bind because we don’t want to start a larger fight with whoever’s behind this. That’s why we’re looking for some hired help who can quickly and discreetly take care of it for us. Interested?\n\nLast thing, once you’re out there, make sure to keep an eye on that ship. Bet as soon as you start blowin’ up their sentries they’re gonna try to bring in some help to stop you.\n \n- Smokey\n
NEW	roughready_claimsweep_desc_hard=The Rough & Ready crew is looking for an independent merc interested in something heavy. We’ve been keeping an eye on a developing situation at ~mission(location|address) where ships are guarding several orbital sentries spying on our operations.      \n\nNow, I might’ve been born at night, but it wasn’t last night. Considering the blatant way they’re set up, whoever’s responsible had to know we’d eventually discover it. Almost feels like they’re baiting R&R into attacking it, and I don’t want us falling for it. \n\nInstead, you’re gonna do it for us and get paid a damn good amount of creds for your effort. The ships stationed there will be less suspicious of an unaffiliated ship approaching and make it harder to pin the attack on us. \n\nJust be sure to plan accordingly before heading in. Maybe bring your own reinforcements in case any of their ships escape and call in some of their own.     \n\n- Smokey\n
NEW	roughready_claimsweep_desc_intro=My associates and I have found ourselves in a little predicament and could use some help. There’s an orbital sentry at ~mission(location|address) that’s spying on us. We don’t know who put it there, but it sure as hell can’t stay. \n\nThing is we’re business minded folks first and foremost and worry that if we blow it up ourselves it’ll start shit. That’s why it’s better if someone like you does it. Should be a quick and easy gig for someone interested in earning some creds.   \n\n- Smokey
NEW	roughready_claimsweep_desc_medium=Recently made an interesting discovery that someone set up a handful of orbital sentries at ~mission(location|address). Guess they’re trying to grab some info about our operations there. They even have a few ships guarding to make sure nothing happens to them. \n\nOf course, we want these bastards gone, but I’m worried that getting rid of it ourselves would be bad for business. That’s why we’re looking for a little ‘plausible deniability’. Someone from outside of R&R to eliminate the problem, so whoever is behind it can’t directly tie the attack back to us. I know this won’t be a walk in the park, especially with those guards lurking. Who knows how many reinforcements they have at the ready? But if you manage to get it done, we’re prepared to see you paid right. \n\nThink you’ve got the skills to pull this off? \n\n- Smokey\n
NEW	roughready_claimsweep_desc_rand=Interested in getting your hands dirty? Turns out someone set up a little operation at ~mission(location|address) to spy on Rough & Ready’s business dealings.

We don’t know who’s behind it, what kind of reinforcements they have waiting, or why they’re targeting us, but it’s definitely not for something good.  \n\nNow, we could take care of it ourselves but have business interests to consider. Sometimes the best way to protect those interests is to hire mercs to do our dirty work. If you’re interested in making good creds and gaining a little good will with the R&R, now’s your chance.

NEW	xenothreat_eliminateall_CFP_outpost_desc_01=The group of instigators that calls itself “Citizens for Pyro” can no longer be allowed to continue spreading their lies and propaganda without repercussion.\n\nAs a sharp reminder of who really controls Pyro we have issued a kill order to eradicate all “Citizen” presence at ~mission(location|address). Resistance is likely, but we expect you to handle it with little difficulty. Do as directed and you’ll be paid well for your work.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler

Break them of their delusions and leave none alive. You’ll be compensated upon your successful completion of this mission.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler

NEW	xenothreat_eliminatespecific_desc_001=XenoThreat’s efforts to keep outside influences from infecting this system is being tested by a group that dares to call itself Citizens for Pyro. A prominent group member, ~mission(TargetName), has established operations at ~mission(Location|Address) and is already hard at work spreading their lies and propaganda to anyone that will listen. If we want Pyro to remain independent of UEE and alien influence, then something must be done about this now.  \n\nThat’s why XenoThreat is issuing a kill order for ~mission(TargetName|Last). And knowing how important they are to Citizens for Pyro’s operations, I wouldn’t be surprised if you had to fight your way through a bunch of their most fanatical followers first before you even get a shot at them. But remember ~mission(TargetName|Last) is your target, and payment hinges solely on you making sure they’re eliminated. \n\nComm. Spec. Engler
NEW	xenothreat_eliminatespecific_desc_002=The Headhunters have assembled a special strike team whose sole purpose is to attack, disrupt, and undermine our operations. As much as I’m loath to admit it, they’ve had a few small successes and are quickly becoming a concern. \n\nXenoThreat knows the best way to kill a snake is by cutting off its head, so we’re issuing a kill order for the strike team’s commander ~mission(TargetName), who according to our intelligence sources, has been hiding at ~mission(Location|Address) for a few days now. \n\nI’d expect strong resistance from the Headhunter forces there. From what we’ve heard, ~mission(TargetName|Last) got this command partially because of the fierce loyalty they inspire in others. Putting your own crew together to tackle this would be a solid operational strategy. \n\nHappy Head Hunting,\n\nComm. Spec. Engler
