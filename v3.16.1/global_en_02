PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_002_IKeepRunning=I keep running into these people who think stellar cartography is dull. Can you believe it? Cartography! I mean, if you think precisely scanning star systems and charting every single astronomical feature is dull, then I don't even know what to say to you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_003_HeresSomethingYou=Here's something you may find interesting - my surname, Banister, came from the fact that my ancestors like forty or so generations back were master stair craftsmen.

PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_004_LetMeBounce=Let me bounce something off you. I'm debating going to either Cassel or to Green for my vacation and you know what, nevermind. I just decided. Tangaroa it is.

PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_GoAway_IG_002_IllBeHonest=I'll be honest, I'm not sure what you think you're doing here. I definitely can't trust you to help, and if I'm being upfront with you, I really don't want to chat with someone I can't trust. It'd be better if you just go.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_GoAway_IG_003_LookImNot=Look, I'm not saying it's going to be this way forever, but right now I think it'd be better for both of us if you stopped coming here. You go do your stuff. I'll do mine. And if anything changes, I'll let you know.

What these little guys see, I see. Which, yes, means I can totally see you. Right. Now... <pause> Anyway, there was actually a reason to why I\ncomm'd. I'm sorta not allowed to leave my post, important jump point scanning and all, so I was hoping you might be able to help me with something.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailStreak_IG_001_AnotherFailedRescue=Another failed rescue, huh? You haven't crossed a shaman or something, have you? Not that I believe in curses, but in the face of overwhelming evidence it might not hurt to re-evaluate that stance.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailStreak_IG_002_WeKeepTrying=We keep trying to help these people in these distress beacons, but what good is it when these outlaws are getting more and more ruthless. Maybe we have to accept that it's a lost cause.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Fail_IG_005_WantedToLet=Wanted to let you know that I appreciate you risking your life to help those people, even if it ended the way it did.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Ignored_IG_001_IWasA=I was a little surprised you decided not to help that last pilot. Guess I was silly for thinking you were the kind of person who cared about people in trouble.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Ignored_IG_002_ItWasTooBad=It was too bad you weren't able to make it to that last distress beacon in time. I'm thinking about sending the pilot's family a fruit basket. A nice one though, one that isn't all melon.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessStreak_IG_002_ImKindaBlown=I'm kinda blown away by the number of people you've helped out there. It's like you're some kind of insurance fairy, saving hulls before premiums can go up.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessTurnAround_IG_003_WantedToSay=Wanted to say nicely done on that last rescue. You heard someone needed help, you went and tried to help them, and in a surprise turn of events it actually worked. Hopefully this is the start of a trend.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_001_GuessYouWerent=Guess you weren't able to finish that last job. Bit embarrassing, when you think about it. Saying you're going to do something, then changing your mind.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_002_ImSuprisedYou=I'm surprised you canceled on that last job. Must be that modern work ethic my nan was always complaining about.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_003_SawThatYou=Saw that you canceled the last job. That's too bad. I'm guessing you have your reasons but still... oh well.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Generic_Fail_IG_001_OhItWas=Oh It was too bad to hear that last job didn't work out. I feel sort of responsible since I was the one who set you up with it. Oh well, guess these things happen.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Generic_Fail_IG_002_SeemsLikeThings=Seems like things didn't go that smoothly on the last job. Live and learn as nan used to say. She also used to loved eating citrus. Always had an orange or a pomelo on her. I miss her a lot.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_FailStreak_IG_002_LostAnotherProbe=Lost another probe, huh? I guess what they say is true. More probes, more problems.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_FailStreak_IG_003_YoureReallyNot=You're really not having any luck with these probes. Like none. It's almost impressive.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_001_NoLuckOn=No luck on that last probe, huh? Eh...I guess we'll just have to make do without for now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_002_ItsTooBad=It's too bad you're weren't able to deploy that last probe. It would have come in handy.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_003_IDidntThink=I didn't think deploying a probe would be that hard, but I guess it's just one of those things that depends on who's doing it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_004_LooksLikeYou=Looks like you ran into some trouble placing that probe. I will admit, I'm a bit disappointed. I was really hoping to see the data it would've provided.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_005_ShameThatWe=Shame that we couldn't get that last probe deployed. The ICC really counts on those scans.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_SuccessStreak_IG_001_ThoseLastFew=Those last few probes you helped me with, we've been getting some really fanastic data. Who knows, maybe at this rate I'll be a first class junior cartographer soon!
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_SuccessStreak_IG_002_TheMoreOf=The more of those probes you deploy for us, the clearer picture we're getting of the system. It's been a huge help.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_003_YouShouldSee=You should see some of the scans coming in from the last probe you deployed. I mean, it would probably just look like a jumble of numbers to you, but take it from me, it's very exciting.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_004_WantedToLet=Wanted to let you know that we've gotten some really interesting data from the last probe, so thanks again for deploying it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_005_IveBeenSpending=I've been spending a lot of my shift pouring over scans from that last probe. There's some really intriguing stuff coming through.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_001_DecidedToCome=Decided to come back and see if I was still alive? Well, despite a certain someone, I luckily am.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_002_IveBeenThinking=I've been thinking about how that last attack went down and I have to say, it might be worth spending a few more hours training in a flight sim. You know, so you don't let down the next person who relies on you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_003_JustThoughtId=Just thought I'd tell you that I forgive you for what happened during the attack. You tried, and that's what matters.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Success_IG_002_ThanksAgainFor=Thanks again for the help with that attack. I'm still a bit shaken up. I keep jumping at the smallest thing. There was a commercial for popcorn on last night and I nearly had a heart attack.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Success_IG_003_IKeepThinking=I keep thinking about the attack, imagining how many different ways it could have gone wrong... Kind of amazing how many things had to go right for both of us to get through that alive.

PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageFinish_IG_001_JustOutOf=Just out of curiosity, I did ask you to place a probe for me, right? I'm pretty sure I did, but maybe I just thought about doing it, and.. oh wait, no, have it here in my notes. Probe. Awesome. As soon as you have it in position, let me know.

PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageRepos_IG_002_GreatSinceThe=Great. Since the probe is in place, all that's left is to sync the signal and ... I don't understand. It should be sending - Ohhhh. I think I know what's wrong. It's the positioning. Looks like you're going to have to go back and deploy it somewhere else. Here, let me update the coordinates.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageRepos_IG_003_OkayTheProbes=Okay, the probe is in position, so let me run a quick diagnostic. <pause> Crap. That's not gonna work. Looks like we might have to reposition the probe a bit. You mind going back and adjusting its positioning? I'm really sorry.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_1stXIntro_IG_001_SeeSometimesI=See, sometimes I accidentally pick up distress beacons that are outside of ECN range, but if I went chasing after all of them, I'd totally lose my job, not to mention get blown up by outlaws. But on the other hand, it's not like I can just sit here and do nothing, so I try to pass them along and get help when I can. And that's where you come in. If I give you the coordinates, I was hoping you could maybe see if there's anything you could do?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_001_ShootingYouThe=Shooting you the location of a distress beacon. It is going off hard. You gotta help them. Code of space and all, right?

Cause I realized I might be the only who calls them DB. Feel free to start using it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_004_DropWhateverYour=Drop whatever your doing. Two words. Distress bacon. Beacon. Distress beacon. Sorry. I didn't have breakfast. Forget it. Just go help, okay?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_005_ImPickingUp=I'm picking up a faint distress beacon on my scanners. I'll send you the coordiates. Might wanna be careful though, I was just reading about an outlaw pack that liked to use them to lure people into ambushes. Not that it should stop you from looking. Just, you know, don't get ambushed.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_006_PickingUpA=Picking up a distress beacon signal at these coordinates. If you check it out, be careful.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_001_ItDoesNot=It does not sound good. Sending you the location of the signal. I think you should go try to help. I mean, you don't have to. You can do what you want, or whatever. But after hearing this - are you really not going to?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_002_TheyreUnderAttack=They're under attack. Here are the coordinates. You've gotta hurry!

PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_005_ImSendingYou=I'm sending you their location, though to be honest, by the time you get there, not sure how much good you'll be... And I just won the pessismist of the year award. Sorry. Good luck, okay?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_006_ItsComingFrom=It's coming from these coordinates. You should help if you can.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_001_ListenToThis=Listen to this.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_002_IJustGot=(frantic) I just got a comm. Here -
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_003_QuickQuestionFor=Quick question for you. This sounds serious, right?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_004_ReadyForYour=Ready for your unsettling comm of the day? And, yeah. Nightmares for a week.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_005_JustWhenYou=Just when you start to forget that space can be pretty terrible you hear something like this-
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_006_EmergencyCommJust=Emergency comm just came in -
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_001_IPickedUp=I picked up this job posting off the public spec and thought it might be your kinda thing. Sending it over.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_002_FiguredIdPass=Figured I'd pass this along in case your interested in some extra work.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_003_IDontKnow=I don't know if you're busy or just out coasting, but check this out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_004_SawAJob=Saw a job that you might be interested in. I'll send it over.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_005_IfYoureOn=If you're on the hunt for some credits, and I mean, who doesn't need credits, there's a local posting that could be perfect for you. Here.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_001_ImSorryTo=I'm sorry to say, but I don't really have anything exciting to tell you at the moment. Pretty boring here, actually. Well, other than the varied and exciting opportunties afforded me as an employee of the ICC, of course.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_002_GuessWhatTheres=Guess what? There's absolutely nothing going on at the moment. To be honest, if you hadn't shown up when you did, I'd probably be taking a desk nap right now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_003_IDontReally=I don't really have anything to give you right now. Unless of course, you're in the mood to do some laundry. Just kidding, I don't actually want you to do my laundry.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_1stXIntro_IG_001_IfYoureInterested=If you're interested, I could use a hand deploying one of our smaller scan probes. They're what we use to survey the areas that the large probes have a hard time seeing. All you'd have to do is pick one up from the depot, deploy it at the specified coordinates, and then come back here so I can do the final sync and verify everything's working. Best part is, I have a budget to hire contractors with, so you'd actually get paid. Take a look and see what you think.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_001_IHaveA=I have a new location that we need a probe deployed to. Think you can help?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_002_JustGotThe=Just got the coordinates for a new probe deployment site. Any interest?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_003_IfYouHappen=If you happen to be in the mood to deploy some scan probes, today is your lucky day. Take a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_004_SomeNewAnalysis=Some new analysis came in and it seems we need some more detailed scans for a particular sector. I was hoping you could deploy the probe for me. What do you say?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_005_WereTryingTo=We're trying to get a more detailed picture of a sector, which means additional scan probes need to be deployed, which means potential work for you. What do you think?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_001_WeLostContact=We lost contact with one of the probes before it could transfer all of its scan data. I need someone to go recover it and take it to the depot, so we can salvage what we can. Here, I'm sending you the specifics.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_002_TheresAScan=There's a scan probe on the fritz. I was hoping you could grab it and take it to the depot for me. What do you think?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_003_SoItSeems=So it seems that a scan probe - one of my favorites by the way - is having a few problems. Signal's going in an out. Weird anomalous readings. The works. But I'm hoping that we can still salvage the little guy. You up for grabbing it and taking it to the depot for me?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_001_OneOfOur=One of our probes went down and needs to be replaced. Straightforward enough except that whatever took out the probe in the first place might still be there. Maybe outlaws? Maybe a storm? I don't know. Here, take a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_002_GotAReport=Got a report this morning that one of the probes went offline. Not sure what happened. One minute it was humming away nicely. Next minute, nothing. Would be lovely if you could deploy a replacement. Just might want to be extra careful when you out there. Interested?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_003_ANewBlind=A new blindspot just appeared in the grid. Seems that a probe went down. It's actually a little suspicous if you ask me. Probes don't usually just switch off like that on their own. Either way, the end result is the same. We have to replace it ASAP. You up for a run?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_001_IveBeenGetting=I've been getting a bit of interference on one of the scan probes and I was hoping that you might be able to move into a better position for me. Here are the details.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_002_AllTheData=All the data I'm getting back from one of the scan probes isn't making much sense. I think it might need to be repositioned. Here, have a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_003_IveBeenScratching=I've been scratching my head over this distorted data set that we've been getting from one of the scan probes. I've tried everything on this end, but at this point, I think the only way to sort it is to physicaly reposition the probe itself. Which, as you may be guessing, is why I'm mentioning it to you. Feel like doing a bit of reorganizing for me?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_001_NotToSound=Not to sound mysterious or anything, but I'm picking up some really weird pings on my scanners. I don't know if you'd want to check it out and tell me what the hell it is. I would myself, but, you know, I can't leave. <pause> Sorry, forgot the coordinates.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_002_SomethingKindaOdd=Something kinda odd just popped up on my screen and it might be worth checking out. I mean, you don't have to. Might be something cool though... or it could be a chunk of aluminium. I don't know. But I guess that's the point right? Neither of us will know unless you go and see.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_003_SoImGetting=So I'm getting a strange signal on my scan. It's saying it can't ID it. That's odd, right? ID'ing stuff is kind of what scans do. Anyway, not mine apparently, cause I have no clue what they found. Giving you the cords if you're interested in scoping it out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_004_OneOfMy=One of my probes... God, that's a weird lead-off... I just picked up an odd reading. Might be worth checking out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_005_IfYouHave=If you have a second. Could you check out these coordiates? Scans are saying something's there, but can't ID it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_006_MySystemsStuck=My system's stuck processing an unknown reading. I'd love to be able to provide more information on my report than just like five question marks in a row. Think you could take a look at what's at this location?
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_001_ImNotReally=I'm not really sure what's going on with you. I keep thinking you're going to be able to handle stuff, but then I keep finding out that stuff has definitely not been handled and it's beginning to make me wonder if I should maybe not be giving you stuff at all. But who knows, maybe this time's the charm.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_002_IReallyAppreciate=I really appreciate that you're trying to help me out, but at a certain point you're starting to become more of a hinderance. If you can't actually start helping, I'm going to stop asking.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_003_ThisIsA=This is a bit awkward, but I got to say it, you've been having a really hard time out there and it seems like no matter what I ask for your help with, it's just not happening. I think you can do better, but if you can't then, well... then I might have to just accept that it's not going to work.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerAcceptsMission_IG_001_GreatGladYoure=Great, glad you're the one handling it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerAcceptsMission_IG_002_SoundsGood=Sounds good.

PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_IG_002_ThatsFineI=That's fine. I can hopefully find someone else to handle it.

PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_002_AllRightSending=All right, sending your payment. Don't spend it all in one place. Unless you're in a bank. Then it's just good financial prudence.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_003_HereYouveEarned=Here. You've earned this.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_004_IllJustGo=I'll just go ahead and send over your payment.

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_Thanks_IG_002_ThatWasClose=That was close. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't shown up when you did. Still can't believe we were attacked.

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_Thanks_IG_003_WellThatEnded=Well, that ended a lot better than I thought it was going to. I can't help but wonder why they attacked in the first place. I thought everyone loved the ICC? I mean, who can hate a cartographer?

PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_1stFightNoHelp_IG_001_GladYouWerent=[PH] Glad you weren't hurt. If you got a second, we could actually use your help with something. Outlaws keep shutting down comm Arrays in the area. Think dirsupting information flow will give them an edge. We need to guard the perimeter in case they come back. Think you could EVA down and reboot the Array for us?
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_1stXPlayerHelps_IG_001_OhManThanks=[PH] Oh man, thanks for the assist. Things were looking a little tight. If you got a second, we could use your help with one more thing. Outlaws keep shutting down comm Arrays in the area. Think dirsupting information flow will give them an edge. We need to guard the perimeter in case they come back. Think you could EVA down and reboot the Array for us?

PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_FutureWork_IG_002_IfYouSee=[PH] If you see any more Arrays like this one, wouldn't mind you reactivating them. Unofficialy of course.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_FutureWork_IG_003_ImNotThe=[PH] I'm not the one telling you this, if you get me, but they've been hitting a lot of the other Arrays in the area and our manpower's stretched pretty thin. You reset more of these yourself, no one would mind thats for damn sure.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_MistakenTech_IG_001_AhHeyYou=[PH] Ah hey, you must be the tech from Aciedo. The area's clear so you're good to go down and reset the Array.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_MistakenTech_IG_002_AreYouOne=[PH] Are you one of the Aciedo techs? It doesn't look like there's going to be any more trouble for now so feel free to go down and bring the Array back online.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_MistakenTech_IG_003_ManIWish=[PH] Man I wish those outlaws would stop messing with these Arrays. Must have you techs running around like crazy. Don't let me hold you up though, huh. Feel free to get started resetting the Arrays

PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerEnters_Low_IG_001_AttentionPilotStand=[PH] Attention pilot, stand clear and do not engage.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerEnters_Low_IG_002_ThisIsCrusader=[PH] This is Crusader Security. We've got the situation handled.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerEnters_Low_IG_004_ThisAreaIs=[PH] This area is not safe. Please keep moving.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerHelps_IG_001_ThatsTheLast=[PH] That's the last of them. Go ahead and restart the system. We'll keep an eye out.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerHelps_IG_002_ScansClearWell=[PH] Scan's clear. We'll set up a perimeter, can you land and bring the Array back online?
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerHelps_IG_003_IfYouWant=[PH] If you want to keep helping, EVA down and reset the Array. We'll watch your back.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerHelps_IG_004_YouSeemLike=[PH] You seem like you can handle yourself pretty well. How about you bring the Array online? We'll make sure no one jumps you while you're EVAing.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerHelps_IG_005_HeyThatWas=[PH] Hey, that was some pretty decent flying. How are you at EVA? We need to guard the perimeter, but if you could reset the Array, that'd be great.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerLeaves_IG_001_WhereYouGoing=[PH] Where you going?
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerLeaves_IG_002_NotGonnaHelp=[PH] Not gonna help?
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerLeaves_IG_003_AlrightNeverMind=[PH] Alright, never mind then.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_PlayerLeaves_IG_004_FineWellTake=[PH] Fine. We'll take it from here.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_RebootRequest_IG_001_PhewThatsThe=[PH] Phew, that's the last of 'em. It's too bad the damn technicians won't be here for a few days. The whole department's backed up since those outlaw bastards started shutting down Arrays. I'll tell you what, if you're up for it, you could EVA to the Array and restart it. I'd do it myself but you know, corporate politics. Anyway, it's up to you.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_RebootRequest_IG_002_ScansClearBut=[PH] Scan's clear but we're not going to be able to wait around much longer. If you wanted to you could go land and bring the Array back online. Not that I'm asking you to do that but it'd be a pretty nice thing to do if you get me.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_RebootRequest_IG_003_IfYouWant=[PH] If you want to keep helping you could EVA down and reset the Array. We'll pretend we didn't see anything.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_RebootRequest_IG_004_AhYouSeem=[PH] Ah, you seem like you can handle yourself pretty well. How about you go down and bring the Array online? Not officially or anything but it'd help us out.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_ReminderPrompt_IG_001_AreaLooksClear=[PH] Area looks clear. Go ahead and reset the Array.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_ReminderPrompt_IG_002_YoullHaveTo=[PH] You'll have to EVA down to get to the Array control panel.

PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetBattle_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_SendingYouThe=Sending you the coordinates for the Nine Tails fleet generating the quantum blockade. We need to take them out if we want to restore regular travel to the area. Head there and be ready to engage the enemy.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetBattle_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_HeresTheLocation=Here's the location of the Nine Tails fleet. These ships are the ones behind this quantum blockade. If we can eliminate them, then the station will be safe again. They're not going to go easy though. Expect a full out brawl when you arrive.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetBattle_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_UpdatingYouWith=Updating you with the Nine Tails fleet coordinates. I need you to head there and clear out the hostiles responsible for powering the quantum dampener. We take them out, and the blockade will be over.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetBattle_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_004_ThanksForSigning=Thanks for signing up. Every bit of help we get makes it that much more likely we can put a stop to the Nine Tails blockade. Here are the coordinates. This outlaw fleet is the one responsible for the quantum dampening. We take them out and the area should be clear again.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetBattle_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_005_GladYoureWith=Glad you're with us on this. Not going to be easy facing down this Nine Tails fleet, but we take these ships out and we take the quantum dampener out with them. Then this damn blockade will finally be over. Head to the coordinates and let's get this done.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_LookHereI=Look here. I know that last time the Nine Tails blockaded a station and you volunteered to assist Crusader Security things didn't exactly work out. I'm willing to give you another chance though. Head to the first scan area and I expect you to help secure the site. Don't let me down this time.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_AllRightPilot=All right, pilot. Let's not beat around the bush - last time you offered to help with a Nine Tails blockade you were less than reliable. But these bastards are at it again, and I need every ship I can get. Head to the first scan point, and lets see if you can help us locate their fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. I'm surprised to see you're volunteering again. Last time there was a Nine Tails blockade you left us high and dry. But if there's one thing I've learned is that if someone asks for a chance to prove themselves, you might as well let them try. If you're serious about helping this time, we need to secure the first scan point so we can try and locate the main fleet. We'll see if you can do better this time around.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. Thanks for volunteering. I know the last time the Nine Tails blockaded a station we weren't able to capture those responsible, but I'm confident that we can do better this time around. First we got to find their fleet, though. I'm sending you the coordinates for the first scan location. See you there.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Thanks for offering to help end this blockade. I know the Nine Tails got the better of us last time, but that was then and this is now.  If we focus and give a hundred and ten percent, I have every confidence that we can stop them. First though, we have to secure the initial scan point so we can locate their fleet. Head over there now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ISeeThat=I see that you'll be joining us to put an end to the lastest Nine Tails' blockade attempt. Here's hoping things go better for us this time. I sent you the coordinates for our first scan point. Make your way to the site. We will need to secure it to begin searching for their fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceedWell_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_IWasDamn=I was damn glad to see your name pop up. Crusader Security hasn't forgotten your vital contributions to shutting down the Nine Tails last time they tried something like this. Head to the first scan area and let's see if we cant end this blockade like we did the last one.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceedWell_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_RealHappyTo=Real happy to have you with us again. With you on board, I'm sure we'll be just as successful shutting down the Nine Tails blockade this time around. Head to the first scan area and we'll start hunting for their fleet's location. See you there.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceedWell_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_NiceToHave=Nice to have you fighting with us again. Hopefully we can destroy their fleet as successfully as we did last time. Sending you the location of the first point we will need to scan. Head to the coordinates and secure the site.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Very happy to see that you're voluteering again. Nine Tails seem to think they'll have a better chance this time around, but with pilots like you rejoining the fight they're sorely mistaken. First things first, we got to secure the initial scan point before we can locate their fleet. I'll see you there.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman, here. Glad to have you back on board. With how we successfully dealt with the Nine Tails last time around, I have every bit of faith that this current blockade will be shut down with the same efficiency. Let's not waste any time, head to the first scan point and we'll begin our search for the Nine Tails fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. I hoped the Nine Tails would've learned their lesson after we took care of their last blockade. Guess I shouldn't be surprised they're at it again. But just like last time, we'll shut them down again. Head to the first scan point and we'll begin searching for their main fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_001_GladYoullBe=Glad you'll be joining us. We need all the help we can get. I'm Commander Herdsman with Crusader Security and I'll be overseeing this op. The plan is to use scan ships to help us locate whatever the Nine Tails are using to block quantum travel, but we can't do that until we clear a safe zone for the scanners to operate. You have the coordinates of the first scan site. Make your way there now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. Good to have you with us. Crusader Security needs to trace the current location of the main Nine Tails fleet, but can't get our scan ships into position until active hostiles have been cleared. Head to the coordinates now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Nice to see you will be joining Crusader Security for this operation. I have scan ships at the ready to help us locate the main Nine Tails fleet and put an end to this blockade, but we can't begin the scans until we can secure the location. Report to the provided coordinates.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman of Crusader Security. I'm coordinating a protective detail to secure a scan site so we can locate the source of this Nine Tails blockade. Head to the location provided now. And be ready for a fight.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_004_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. I'm happy to see you're joining Crusader Security's efforts to end this blockade. First step will be to ascertain the Nine Tails fleet's location using scan ships. But it will be too risky to deploy them until we can fully secure the scan site. Head there now to assist with clearing any hostiles.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_005_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. You've got the coordinates of the scan site I need you to clear. Once we are sure there are no active hostiles we can begin scanning, find the Nine Tails fleet, and hopefully put a stop to this blockade once and for all. Report to the site as soon as possible.

PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Announce_Mission_FleetBattle_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. We were able to ID the location of the main Nine Tails fleet. I'm hoping you'll sign up to help us put an end to this blockade.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Announce_Mission_FleetBattle_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ComeInPilot=Come in pilot, this is Commander Herdsman. The location of the Nine Tails fleet has been found. I'm hoping you'll sign up to lend us a hand in shutting them down.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Announce_Mission_FleetBattle_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Wanted to inform you that we have discovered the main Nine Tails fleet's whereabouts. It'll be difficult but I'm hoping I can count on your assistance in dealing with them.

PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereLiaison=Hey there. Liaison Officer Vanzant with Crusader Security. I'm the one managing your contract with us to - says here, "Destroy Illegal Contraband." Ah, right. Basically, criminals have been setting up these automated production facilities that can just keep turning out product like its nothing. We got coordinates on one of these sites, and we want you to go destroy all the contraband they make. We even got a nice little bonus scheme set up where we'll pay you based on how much product you manage to take off the market. You'll be doing good for the community, and getting a good salary to do it. Nothing wrong with that, right?
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HiImYour=Hi, I'm your Crusader Security Liaison Officer for this contract. That means I'll be supervising while you deal with this automated facility. You should have the details, but the idea is that you'll infiltrate the compound and destroy the packages as they come off the production line, preventing them from getting out into the wild. While the manufacturing process takes care of itself, I wouldn't be surprised if you run into some outlaw resistance anyway. Go in prepared, and you should come out alright. Good luck.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyLiaisonOfficer=Hey, Liaison Officer Vanzant here. Thanks for agreeing to help us deal with this illegal production facility. Crusader Security is very eager to make sure that whatever products are coming off the line don't make it onto market. Once you're on site, deal with whatever resistance there is, and destroy as much of the contraband as you can. Ideally all of it. I sent you the details so you should be all set to go. Safe flying.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HiThisIs=Hi, this is Liaison Officer Vanzant with Crusader Security. I'll be overseeing your contract with us. Appreciate your help in dealing with this illegal production facility. As outlined, the hope is that you'll be able to secure the site and confiscate any contraband you find for delivery to our evidence hold. Now, these so-called criminal geniuses have managed to automate a lot of the production, so its unclear how long they'll be manufacturing product for or how many outlaws will be on site, but I'd go in ready to face some serious resistance. Could get pretty nasty... Sure you'll be fine though. I'll check in on you later.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_GreetingsImA=Greetings. I'm a Liaison Officer with Crusader Security and I'll be supervising your work in helping us deal with this illegal production facility today. It's one of the newer automated style where it's pretty much hands free for the outlaws. Crazy how advanced these things are getting. We'd like you to go there and secure as many of the crates of contraband as you can and bring them to us for processing and disposal. And of course, if there any hostile forces present, you're expected to deal with them as appropriate. And remember, caution is the keyword all around.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyThereCrusader=Hey there. Crusader Security Officer Vanzant comming you about the contract work. Just wanted to make sure everything was clear. You're going to be headed to an automated production facility and grabbing all the contraband that comes off the line. Once you have it secured, you're to bring them to the appointed location so we can properly analyze and dispose of it. Not sure what exactly you can expect in terms of hostile resistance, but it usually pays to be ready for a fight. And just to say it, I'm really happy we hired you for this. Will be great to get all this contraband off the market before it does any damage.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_ExpVet_IG_001_HiThereLiaison=Hi there. Liaison Officer Vanzant. Happy to see you'll be helping Crusader Security out with this contract. With the work you've been doing so far, I'm sure you'll be able to take care of this one no problem. Updating you with all the details now.

PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HiThereIm=Hi there. I'm the Crusader Security Liaison Officer overseeing your contract. You should have all the important details now, and I'll be monitoring you're progress as you go. Good luck out there.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyImOfficer=Hey, I'm Officer Vanzant with Crusader Security. Thanks for taking this contract. I'm updating the details for you now but it should all be pretty clear. Just remember to keep your head down and be safe. Don't want to lose anybody on my watch. All right, get to it and I'll check in on you later.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyCommingYou=Hey, comming you on behalf of Crusader Security. I'll be supervising your current contract with us. All the details have been forwarded so hopefully that covers everything you need to get started. I'll check in with you periodically, but until then, good luck and be safe.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereThis=Hey there, this is Crusader Security Liaison Officer Vanzant comming about the contract. I'll be your point of contact on this job but it should hopefully be straightforward. You have all details so feel free to get going right away. Just make sure to stock up on any supplies you'll need. Nothing worse than being caught unprepared. Good luck.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsOfficer=Hey, it's Officer Vanzant again. Just wanted to pass along that the Crusader Security personnel on patrol in your sector have been notified that you're delivering some contraband to our evidence hold for us. You shouldn't run into any problem as you make your way there. At least from us. There's probably a few outlaws out there who'd like to get their product back. Actually, might be a good idea for you make the delivery as fast as you can. Won't be safe flying around too long with this stuff.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyThereOfficer=Hey there. Officer Vanzant. Wanted to let you know that I notified the local patrols that you'd be heading through the sector. Didn't want them to be surprised when a ship carting a bunch of contraband turned up. Also told them to keep an eye out for anybody who might be trying to get their hands on that stash you're hauling. Hopefully you won't have any trouble on your way to the drop off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HiLiaisonOfficer=Hi, Liaison Officer Vanzant here. Didn't want you to run into any trouble on your way to the evidence hold, so I've gone ahead and alerted Crusader Security patrols in the area that you're authorized to be traveling with contraband aboard. Should make things easier for you. Now all you have to do is avoid any outlaws trying to take their drugs back and you'll be fine.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_SoJustGot=So, just got a tip hot off the wire. Seems these perps didn?t like us interfering and the site's been ordered offline. Since, they won't be producing any more contraband, destroy whatever's left before heading off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WantedToPass=Wanted to pass along an update. The production line's going to be shutting down. Guess these bastards decided to count their losses or lick their wounds or whatever. Go ahead and finish destroying whatever contraband is still on site and then we should be all set.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyGotA=Hey, got a report from an informant that the production line's going dark. They probably figured there's no point in making more if we're just going to destroy all of it. Speaking of, finishing destroying whatever you can find left down there and then you're good to clear out.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyOneOf=Hey, one of our contacts just let us know that the people operating the site got word of our operation and ordered it to go dark. Collect whatever you can, and bring it to the evidence hold. It's not worth you hanging around there longer than you have to.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyIfThis=Hey, if this report I got is right, that production line should be shutting down any moment now. Finish collecting whatever contraband you can get your hands on and go ahead and bring it to the drop off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_SoLooksLike=So, looks like they're going to be deactivating the production line at the sight. Guess the criminals finally got word of what we were up to. Since their won't be any more contraband coming off the line, finish collecting whatever there is and bring it to the evidence hold. Thanks.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_OfficerVanzantHere=Officer Vanzant here. I was rooting for you, but with your performance I have no choice but to unfortunately terminate your contract. Sorry, it didn't work out.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_LookImGonna=Look, I'm gonna give it to you straight. You just weren't up to snuff this time around. Nothing you can't overcome with a bit of a hard work and practice, but for now I'm going to have to terminate the contract. Hopefully things turn around for you soon.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeySoFrom=Hey. So from what I'm seeing your performance isn't up to Crusader Security standards. Gonna go ahead and cancel your contract. Guess you just weren't the right person for this job, huh?
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ThisIsOfficer=This is Officer Vanzant again. It's not good. Your performance has been sub-par and I'm canceling the contract. Nothing personal. Have a good one, okay.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_AllRightTheres=All right, there's no easy way to say this, but I'm terminating your contract. Your performance just wasn't meeting our requirements for this job. That's it. Good luck out there.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_GeezWhatAre=Geez, what are you thinking? That just because you're working for us you can break the law? That's not how it works, buddy. Contract's canceled, and you can forget about working with Crusader Security until you get your life sorted.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_AmIReading=Am I reading this right? Did you actually get a crimestat while working as a security contractor? Talk about not knowing which way your feet are facing. It goes without saying, but we can't have an active criminal on the payroll, so you're fired. Good luck with your legal problems.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyNotSure=Hey, not sure what the hell happened, but an active crimestat means you can't work for Crusader Security. I gotta cut you loose. Contract's over.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_LookIfWe=Look, if we knew you were going to be out there breaking the law, Crusader Security never would have hired you in the first place. That crimestat means you're terminated. That's just how it is.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_DidYouSeriously=Did you seriously just get a crimestat? I know things can get tricky out there but I expected you to be more careful than this. Whatever happened, I'm gonna have to cut you loose. Crusader Security doesn't employ criminals. All right, contract's terminated.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_IllegalKiosk_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_WoahYoureGoing=Woah, you're going around selling this stuff? I can't believe you'd betray our trust like that. You can forget about the contract. Hell, you can forget about working for Crusader again for a very long time.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_IllegalKiosk_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyDidYou=Hey! Did you actually think selling the illegal contraband we hired you to collect was a good idea? Unbelievable! You are so fired. I can't even comprehend what was going through your mind. You know what, I don't care. I'm done with you.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_IllegalKiosk_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IDidntWant=I didn't want to believe it at first, but I can't argue with the evidence. I can't believe you'd stab me in the back like this. Do you have any idea what kind of damage that contraband you sold will do to the community? Forget it. There's no point in talking to someone like you.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyHateTo=Hey, hate to do this, but it seems that Crusader Security isn't going to need your help on this contract after all. Don't worry though. This won't reflect on you at all. Next contract, we'd be happy to have you back. Safe flying until then.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyCommingWith=Hey, comming with a bit of bad news. I have to close out the contract. You didn't do anything wrong, it?s just the higher ups have decided our resources will be better spent elsewhere. Apologies. Hopefully this won't happen again.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsVanzant=Hey, it's Vanzant. Wanted to let you know that I have to cancel the contract. It's not your fault in the slightest, just one of those things. Crap luck really. Anyway, hopefully we'll have another job for you soon and we can make it up to you. All right. Have a good one.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyReallyHate=Hey, really hate to do this to you, but I'm canceling the contract. The situation's changed and we won't be needing you after all. Hope you're not too mad. Would love to have you on another job in the future. Okay. Sorry again.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_OkayDontShoot=Okay, don't shoot the messenger here, but Crusader Security is terminating this contract. Nothing you did. It just happens sometimes and you unfortunately got the short straw. Hopefully, next time you work with us things will go smoother.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_ListenUpThis=Listen up. This is Security Officer Vanzant and it is my obligation to hereby notify you that due to breach of contract, your employment is hereby terminated.

PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Inform_Mission_StatusUpdate_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyHopeIm=Hey, hope I'm not interrupting anything. Had gotten a status update on your progress and wanted to say that it seems you're more or less on target. Just keep doing what you've been doing and we'll be all set.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Inform_Mission_StatusUpdate_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyThereIts=Hey there, it's Officer Vanzant. Just hopping on the comm to say good work so far. All the progress updates I've gotten have been pretty much on track, so that's great. Hopefully, we'll be able to close this thing out soon. Keep it up.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Inform_Mission_StatusUpdate_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyHowsIt=Hey, how's it going? Everything's pretty good on my end. Really liking these status reports I'm seeing on your progress. Crusader Security always appreciates contractors who can stay on task and get a job done. At this rate, the whole contract should be finished before too long. And then the best part, getting paid! Okay, I'll check in again later.

I tried to send you flowers, but there was a  whole thing, but anyway, I'm glad you?re feeling better now. The contract is still yours if you want it. And hopefully you can get it taken care of this time while staying in one piece! Just kidding. Be safe and good luck.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Remind_Mission_Respawn_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyFeelingBetter=Hey, feeling better? This regen stuff's a real miracle isn't it? Anyway, now that you're moving about again, the contract is still waiting for you to finish. Figured you'd appreciate the chance to close it out.

I need you to get back on track with this contract, okay? If you can't do that for me, I'm afraid my hands are tied. I'll have to let you go.

PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Steal_Retrieve_IG_001_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to say no, but a little bird gave me the location of some unfortunates who have been attacking convoys heading through the system. Now, should you eliminate them, it seems like that would produce some salvageable materials, no?

PU_DARNEELY_MG_MultipleMissionOffer_IG_001_IAmSimply=I am simply overwhelmed with the prospects of employment. Far too many to keep track of. Let me know if you may alleviate me.
PU_DARNEELY_MG_MultipleMissionOffer_IG_002_LikeNiscesHerself=Like Nisces herself, I have become a confluence of opportunity. See for yourself.

PU_ECKHART_MG_Intro_PlayerSits_V_WP_Bad_004_IfImWrong=If I'm wrong, we can leave it at that. Enjoy a drink in my spectacular company for a few minutes then we'll part ways with the understanding that this meeting never happened.
PU_ECKHART_MG_Intro_PlayerSits_V_WP_Bad_005_IfImRight=But if I'm right, then I might just have a gig that I could use you for.
PU_ECKHART_MG_Intro_PlayerSits_V_WP_Good_001_SorryForThe=Sorry for the locale, don't look like much but the homemade stuff has some kick. Anyway, I've been hearing good things about you.

PU_ECKHART_MG_MissionBriefs_Bounty_Good_IG_001_IEverTell=I ever tell you that I started out as a bounty hunter? Yeah, after three tours, I guess I wasn't ready for the dogfighting to end.

PU_HURSTON_MG_MissionBriefs_Collect_Find_IG_001_HeadOfficeHas=Head office has been circulating a req list for open fulfillment. They haven't really attached any information about where to find them...

PU_HURSTON_MG_MissionBriefs_Collect_SpecificPrice_IG_001_IveGotA=I've got a new request list for resources. There's just one snag. Corporate has frozen the price they're willing to pay, so whatever you need to do to get them at this price... you do. I don't want to know.
PU_HURSTON_MG_MissionBriefs_Collect_SpecificPrice_Repeat_IG_001_MySupervisorWas=My supervisor was thrilled you could snag those resources... I hope whatever you did before, you can do again.

PU_HURSTON_MG_SuggestTerm_IG_002_IfYouWant=If you want, there are those terminals outside. Most sub-premium contractors make do with those.
PU_HURSTON_MG_Transition_CommentToGiving_IG_001_ShallWeGet=Shall we get down to business?
PU_HURSTON_MG_Transition_CommentToGiving_IG_002_ButLetsMove=But let's move on...
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_GeneralInfo_IG_001_WhetherItsInnovative=Whether its innovative specialty craft, reliable workhorses or tried and true defenders, the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo is where spaceship enthusiasts come to take flight.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_GeneralInfo_IG_002_WhetherItsStepping=Whether it's stepping into an unknown system or coasting the well traveled routes of your home sector, how you get there is half the fun. Find your next craft of choice at the 2951 IAE. Dare to fly.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_GeneralInfo_IG_003_DidYouDiscover=Did you discover the craft of your dreams at this year's IAE? Then why not experience it first hand with a test flight? Many of the vehicles on display at this year's IAE are available to rent from one of our local providers.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_GeneralInfo_IG_004_ReadyToLearn=Ready to learn more about the manufacturers and ships on display? The all new 2951 IAE immersive audio experience is the perfect way to get more info about why adventurous pilots across the universe "Dare to Fly."
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_LocationInfo_TobinExpoCenter_IG_001_ThisIsA=This is a friendly reminder that the Tobin Expo Center is a shared space. Please be mindful of other guests during your visit so that we can all enjoy this day together.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_LocationInfo_TobinExpoCenter_IG_002_DueToHeightened=Due to heightened security measures in the Stanton System, microTech Protection Services are asking all guests to be extra vigilant when it comes to safety. If you see anything of concern, please alert a member of staff as soon as possible. Thank you.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_LocationInfo_TobinExpoCenter_IG_003_AttentionVisitorsTo=Attention visitors to the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo - Please remember to stay hydrated while exploring the exhibits on display. For your convenience, a selection of beverages and tasty snacks are available for purchase in the lobby.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_LocationInfo_TobinExpoCenter_IG_004_TobinExpoCenter=Tobin Expo Center would like to invite everyone to join in and help keep our halls looking their best, for every guest. Please be sure to keep track of all your belongings and deposit any waste in the appropriate receptacles. Thanks.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_PilotPortraits_IG_001_ToCommemorateThis=To commemorate this year's theme of "Dare to Fly," the IAE wanted to celebrate those who wear the mantle of 'pilot' each and every day. This unique portrait series features pilots from around the universe, captured through the eye of famed portrait artist, Aruto Divani.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Warn_Expo_Closing_IG_001_AttentionGuestsThis=Attention guests, this Expo hall is about to close for maintenance. Please make your way to the exit and be sure to visit us again soon.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Welcome_Entrance_IG_001_WelcomeToThe=Welcome to the 2951 Intergalactic Aerospace Expo, where we're celebrating those who "Dare to Fly."
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Welcome_Entrance_IG_002_ThankYouFor=Thank you for visiting New Babbage's Tobin Expo Center, Stanton's preeminent destination for live events and exhibitions.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_BestInShow_IG_001_SelectedByPopular=Selected by popular vote, the IAE Best in Show line up is a chance for your favorite ships to take center stage at the expo. At least most of the time. At the 2938 Expo, that year's winners were all ships too large to actually fit inside the show hall!
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_PilotsIntro_IG_001_WhileItMay=While it may be commonplace to sail through the stars, we should never lose sight of the wonders of space flight from discovering new jump points, unearthing lost ruins, or setting new speed records. Famed artist, Aruto Divani, created this unique portrait series as a tribute to the diverse array of people who eagerly climb aboard their ships and 'Dare to Fly.'
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_Ship_MISCOdyssey_IG_001_MISCsLatestAddition=MISC's latest addition to their already impressive line of ships perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this year's IAE. Push the boundaries of the known universe with their new multi-crew wayfarer ship, the Odyssey. Get a sneak peek in the holoviewer room. Only at the IAE.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_AEGS_IG_001_FewCompaniesHave=Few companies have had as tumultuous a history as Aegis Dynamics. From its earliest days manufacturing iconic warships of the First Tevarin War through the darkest days of the Messer regime, Aegis ships have found a resurgence in the public eye for their versatility and robust construction.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_AEGS_IG_002_NoShipManufacturer=No ship manufacturer personifies this year's theme better than Aegis Dynamics. Whether you're running cargo in a Retaliator or providing security in a Gladius, Aegis ships are putting in work in every corner of the 'verse. Regardless of the controversies that have plagued them over the centuries, pilots continue to trust their lives and livelihood to their tried and true designs.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ANVL_IG_001_AnvilAerospaceMay=Anvil Aerospace may have made a name for itself along the frontlines with its masterfully built fleet of military craft, but more and more of the company's civilian craft have captured the imagination of the Empire. Look no further than the Anvil Carrack to see a ship that has transitioned easily from its Naval origins to the very edges of space as pilots use the ship to chart new territory.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ANVL_IG_002_AsTheWar=As the war against the Vanduul continues, many pilots find themselves seeking a way to protect their home and loved ones during these uncertain times. Anvil Aerospace has been a strong ally in this endeavor, creating civilian versions of their popular military craft, like the Hornet F7-C, to protect you and the ones you care about.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ARGO_IG_001_ContraryToPopular=Contrary to popular belief, Argo Astronautics name doesn't come from the ancient water craft of Earth mythology, but rather is derived from the initials of the company's founder Alana Redmond and is attributed to her mother.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_BANU_IG_001_ItsNotUncommon=It's not uncommon for Human manufacturers to offer unique features and designs to make their ships stand out from the crowd, but the Banu take a slightly different approach when it comes to crafting their vehicles. Heavily and freely borrowing from each other and even other species, Banu ships are made by combining the best features and best technology that they can get their hands on.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CNOU_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the newer ship manufacturers to debut at the IAE, Consolidated Outlands has already made its mark on the Expo when it introduced the first ever mobile construction yard in 2947. The Pioneer opened up exciting opportunities for planetary settlement by allowing settlers to create their own modular structures, and forever changing the idea of what a spacecraft could do.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CRUS_IG_001_CrusaderIndustriesContinues=Crusader Industries continues to surprise ship enthusiasts around the empire. Initially known for their commercial transports like the Genesis Starliner and the Hercules StarLifter, Crusader has been expanding into the civilian market with the introduction of their Ares Star Fighter and Mercury Star Runner. Needless to say, the future is bright for this titan of astro-engineering.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CRUS_IG_002_UnlikeManyOf=Unlike many of their competitors, Crusader Industries dedicates as much effort on their employees as they do on their products. Recognized as one of the UEE's best employers in 2943 and 2946, Crusader not only offers competitive pay and benefit programs to all employees, but also houses extensive in-house  training and education programs to foster talent and take their workers to the next level of their career.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_DRAK_IG_001_MentionTheName=Mention the name Drake Interplanetary in a room and you're sure to kick off some debate. To some, they're villains, arming the most dangerous elements in the 'verse with the tools to wreak havoc. But did you know that this criminal connection was only made possible because Drake ships were so common? In the infamous Kesselring Heist of 2903, a Drake caterpillar was used specifically because it was easy to blend in with the masses in flight.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_DRAK_IG_002_NoOneBrings=No one brings the thunder to IAE quite like Drake Interplanetary. Love 'em or hate 'em, their ships have become versatile and affordable options for everyone from security and militia forces to haulers trying to scrape a living out in the black. The Drake Red medic ship was recently recognized for the 'most lives saved' thanks to the ship's usage in medstations and hospitals around the UEE.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ESPR_IG_001_ThoughTheExpo=Though the Expo attracts the latest innovations and technological wonders, Esperia is constantly paving the way forward with their reverence of the past. Preserving important historical craft and xeno-vehicles, Esperia defines spaceflight in entirely new ways by providing unique experiences that would otherwise be unavailable to modern pilots.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_GRIN_IG_001_GreycatIndustrialHolds=Greycat Industrial holds the distinction of having the most ever vehicles at a single IAE when in 2926 a thousand buggy parade was driven through the streets of Severus. The highlight was when all of the buggy's sounded their horns together to play a rendition of the Imperial anthem.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_MISC_IG_001_ItsCommonKnowledge=It's common knowledge that MISC builds some of the hardest working ships around, but to get that tough a lot of thought and careful consideration had to go into even the smallest of details. To find the best panel adhesive, MISC ran over a million thermocycle shock tests at their R&D center. The winner alone was able to survive tens of thousands of cycles without failing. Talk about being built to last.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_MISC_IG_002_RepresentedInAlmost=Represented in almost every industry, MISC continues to create reliable, durable, and versatile ships at a variety of pricepoints. One of their toughest tests is known affectionately as the "Meat Grinder." Though the specifics of the test are a proprietary secret, insiders claim that the test aims to inundate the prototype ship with nearly three dozen adverse conditions, sometimes attacking with three to four at the same time in an effort to prove that their ship can survive the harshest of the harsh conditions.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ORIG_IG_001_LuxuryElegancePerformance=Luxury. Elegance. Performance. These are only a handful of the terms that are regularly associated with Origin Jumpworks ships. Since the 28th century, Origin has consistently pushed the boundaries of speed and sophistication, but did you know that their controversial decision to uproot their headquarters from Earth to Terra in 2913 nearly sank the company?
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ORIG_IG_002_PerpetuallyExpandingWhats=Perpetually expanding what's possible when it comes to high-end performance vehicles, Origin Jumpworks is a fan favorite at the IAE and this year's lineup is sure to impress. When attempting to design a new addition to their roster, Origin engineers have looked for inspiration from a variety of sources. For example, when initially brainstorming designs that would ultimately become the X1, Engineering Director Alberto Vara looked to musical notes to dictate the potential shape language of the open-canopy racer.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_RSI_IG_001_SomeHistoriansCredit=Some historians credit Roberts Space Industries with the invention of modern spaceflight. For founder Chris Roberts, the prospect of making space travel more accessible was a lifelong dream and when his company unveiled their prototype Quantum Core Engine in 2075, suddenly, space travel didn?t seem that fantastical anymore.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_RSI_IG_002_ItsPrettyAmazing=It's pretty amazing to think that RSI makes one of the smallest ships on the market and one of the biggest. It would take about 50 Auroras laid end to end to equal the length of one mighty Bengal carrier.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_XIAN_IG_001_XianShipsAre=Xi'an ships are becoming a more common sight across the UEE, but it wasn't too long ago that their sale was completely forbidden by the Xi'an Emperor. Now, thanks to growing trade between our two species, Xi'an manufacturers like Gatac and Aopoa are producing vehicles specifically for Humans to pilot. Even more promising, some new ships have been designed for Human and Xi'an crew to serve along side each other.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_AegisRedeemer_IG_001_EstablishingFireSuperiority=Establishing fire superiority can be the key to victory. Aegis designers consulted with both active and former members of the UEE military as well as security forces to find out what was and wasn't currently represented in the latest generation of combat gunships. The result? The Aegis Redeemer. Originally debuted years ago, Aegis made the somewhat controversial decision to delay the release of this battlefield equalizer to redesign the interior.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_AnvilSpartan_IG_001_DespiteTheAerospace=Despite the Aerospace in it's name, Anvil has hardly been limited to the skies. For example, the tough and rugged Atlas vehicle platform was developed to help conquer the unforgiving landscape found on moons and planets alike. Both the Ballista and the Spartan were both built from this design foundation, proving its adaptability.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_ArgoRAFT_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to crack into the cargo hauling market, look no further than Argo's new RAFT. This small multi-crew ship utilizes Argo's experience in the industrial ship market and a versatile design to create an affordable entry-level ship that's ready for the long haul.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_CrusaderAres_IG_001_AlthoughCrusaderIndustries=Although Crusader Industries might be best known for their transports, their recent introduction of the Ares Star Fighter shows that the charity-minded manufacturer is taking a new approach to helping citizens across the Empire, and more specifically those who live on Crusader itself. With recent attacks by well outfitted groups like XenoThreat and the Nine Tails becoming all too common, its easy to see why a powerhouse like the Ares was added to their line-up.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_DrakeBuccaneer_IG_001_IntroducedIn2887=Introduced in 2887, Drake's Buccaneer almost begs its pilots to pick a fight. While it doesn't have the versatility of something like the Hornet, the Bucc's got heart... and enough firepower to make it a serious threat in any engagement. Though it's been associated with multiple crimes throughout the Empire, it's also become a mainstay for local security forces and militias looking to keep the peace.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_Origin400i_IG_001_InitiallyConceptedTo=Initially concepted to be a competitor for RSI's classic Constellation line, Origin's 400i quickly developed  its own singular identity. Utilizing Origin's usual high standards of performance and comfort, the 400i evolved into a ship for explorers who didn't feel the need to 'rough it' while pushing the boundaries of the known.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_RSIConstellation_IG_001_SinceItsIntroduction=Since its introduction in 2712, the RSI Constellation has been reimagined countless times, proving itself as varied and long-lived as Roberts Space Industries itself. It has been a cargo hauler, an explorer, a luxury liner, and more. When asked what's next for the Constellation, RSI Designer Deshondra Lewin said "Whatever it is, we will always strive to balance innovation with the tested features that pilots have come to rely upon."
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_ThemeIntro_IG_001_TheThemeOf=The theme of this year's expo is "Dare to Fly" which celebrates the courage of pilots everywhere who boldly take flight to discover new thrills, to seek adventure, and to push boundaries farther than ever imagined. With the right ship and the right frame of mind, anything is possible.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_WeaponsArmor_IG_001_YouMayBe=You may be wondering why an Expo focused on vehicles and spacecraft would want to highlight personal armor and weapons. While its true that getting there is half the fun, what you do when you arrive is just as important. Having the perfect gear on board will help ensure that a landed pilot will be ready to take off again soon.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Welcome_Tour_IG_001_HelloAndWelcome=Hello and welcome to the 2951 Intergalactic Aerospace Expo. This special audio presentation will be your guide to the ins and outs of the various halls and provide unique insight about the vehicles and manufacturers on display.

PU_JTVOGUIDE01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_BriefingRoom_IG_001_HelloAndWelcome=Hello and welcome to the UEES War Hammer. This Javelin-Class destroyer was originally built by Aegis Dynamics and has been in active service since 2832. Launching under the command of Captain Omar Singh, the ship initially served as a combat support vessel in the 2nd Fleet, 6th Battle Group. A posting that put it close to the Vanduul front. The War Hammer saw action during the Fall of Caliban in 2884 where it protected retreating civilian and Naval forces when the system ultimately fell, earning a ribbon for Valor in the process. For the next several decades, the War Hammer transitioned between fleets in a variety of support and patrol positions, even participating in the UEE push to reclaim the Nexus system in the 2930's. Most recently, the War Hammer distinguished itself as the primary combat vessel to repel the outlaw group known as XenoThreat from the Stanton system. Since then, the War Hammer has been placed in drydock for repairs, but is heading back to active service once this year's Invictus festivities are concluded.\n\nThe room you're currently seated in is the main briefing room for the entire ship. Based around a holovolume built by microTech, the crew gathers here to discuss everything from battle strategies to repair schedules. The Marine detail assigned to this ship also uses this room to plan out their boarding actions or outline combat strategies. This room has even acted as a venue for off-duty activities such as vid screenings or sporting event parties.\n\nWe hope that you'll take the opportunity to explore the ship and get an up close look at one of the vanguards of order. On behalf of Captain Medcalf and the rest of the crew, I want to wish you a fantastic Invictus and hope we see you next year.
