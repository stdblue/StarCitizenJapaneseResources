Covalex_Danger_001=One more thing, I'm seeing here that you'll be working in a heightened safety area. I'm sure you always follow best practices, but a little extra caution probably wouldn't be a bad idea. Better safe than sorry, right! 
Covalex_Danger_002=One last thing, it looks like some of our previous operators have reported outlaw activity in the area. Might be a good idea to plan for some extra security precautions. But if you do get into a situation (though you probably won't!), remember Covalex's policy of 'Flight, not fight.' 
Covalex_Danger_003=Also, unfortunately, it seems a security flag has been placed on this contract. Nothing to worry about too much... but that said, you should probably at least be extra careful during this job. Be ready for anything and you'll never be surprised! 
Covalex_Danger_004=One more little wrinkle. The system has flagged this contract as potentially hazardous. It might not mean anything, but don't be too surprised if you run into a bump or two or three while completing this one. 
Covalex_Danger_005=Last thing. This contract has been given a security flag. They add those when there is a higher risk involved. Sometimes it's hazardous routes, sometimes outlaw sightings, but you're going to want to be extra sharp on this one.

Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_001=Hi,\n\nWe are in a bit of a tight spot, over here at Covalex. A shipment of Diluthermex was accidentally delivered to the wrong location and we're looking to get it delivered correctly as quickly as possible. It's the least we can do for our clients. \n\nNow the tricky bit of business is that Diluthermex is a bit unstable when exposed to quantum travel.\n\nNormally, we would have a fully kitted cargo ship handle the delivery, but since time is of the essence, I'm hoping you can do it and just not QT while you have it aboard your craft. Not ideal, but as long as you have a full tank of fuel you should be fine.\n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nRemember, slow and steady but as fast as possible!\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation. By accepting this contract, you are agreeing to all terms and conditions as outlined in our extended 'Independent Workers Supplemental Information Guide v.2948.01.29.' Covalex Shipping is not responsible for any damages that occur while operating as an independent contractor.
Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_002=Hi,\n\nGot a problem that I'm really hoping you can help me sort out. \n\nA shipment of Diluthermex was mistakenly delivered to the wrong address and they need be correctly delivered as soon as possible. \n\nTo further complicate things, as you may or may not know, Diluthermex is quantum sensitive which means that you either need a properly shielded hold or you can't QT with it onboard. \n\nUsually, I would bring in a contractor who had the proper set up, but with everything already so delayed, I'm just going to trust you to deliver these the old fashion way.\n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nAnd since you're going to be flying at regular speeds, I definitely recommend making sure to top off your fuel tank before heading out. Don't want to get stranded half way.\n\nThanks again for helping me out of this bind!\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation. By accepting this contract, you are agreeing to all terms and conditions as outlined in our extended 'Independent Workers Supplemental Information Guide v.2948.01.29.' Covalex Shipping is not responsible for any damages that occur while operating as an independent contractor.
Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_003=Hi,\n\nSo it seems that some forms got processed incorrectly and a shipment of Diluthermex was mistakenly delivered to the wrong address. Unfortunately, we only realized the mistake after the original transport ship left the system and now I need another pilot to correctly finish the delivery.\n\nThe reason why it would have been better for the original ship to take care of this is that delivery was quantum sensitive Diluthermex. Without the proper shielding, I'm afraid you'll have to make the deliveries without using your quantum drives or risk damaging the shipment (and your ship). \n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nBut hey, flying a little bit slower can be nice sometimes. Just think about all the pretty views! As long as you got a full tank of fuel, why not sit back and enjoy the flight. \n\nAppreciate your help,\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_001=You haven't been having much luck out there have you? I don't want to get too overly dramatic, but your performance stats over the last few contracts have been falling well below average. However, your luck hasn't completely run out! Covalex believes firmly in cultivating talent and allowing people to learn from our mistakes ( Thankfully! I probably wouldn't be here otherwise :p ). So, let's put all that behind us as a learning experience and meet the future head on! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_002=This is part of my job that I do not look forward to. We have to talk about your recent string of contracts. Things have just not been going your way have they? I'm not gonna sugar coat it, your performance stats are not look so hot. But you know what they say, nothing makes up for the past like the present. Let's get you back out there, and see what you can really do. 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Got to say, you really turned it around with that last job! Awesome work! Now, let's just keep it up! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Congrats on the flipping your performance status around! I was rooting for you, and sure enough, you really proved on that last job that when push comes to shove, you can get it done. Now we just got to keep that momentum going! 
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_001=Hate to do this, but wanted to check in about that last contract. Seems like you had some problems. Now, while we all run into unavoidable obstacles from time to time, I'm going to encourage you to take a moment to think about what went wrong and three things that you can improve upon for your next contract. It's a little exercise that always helps me improve my performance, and isn't that what life is about? Self improvement? All right, back to the exciting new business at hand! 
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_002=To get a bit of business out of the way, I briefly wanted to mention your performance on the last contract. I have in my notes that it was less than satisfactory. Probably just an off day, and I sure know about those, but I would like to strongly encourage you to use this contract as an opportunity to show us just how good you really are. 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=I was looking back through my records and wow! You've been doing a fantastic job recently. I've talked about you to some of the other Jr. Logistics Operators, and you didn't hear it from me, but they're pretty jealous I'm working with such a stellar contractor. Keep this up and we'll both be Covalex stars! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=First off, I want to let you know how much I, and everyone here at Covalex Shipping, really appreciate the hard work you've been putting in. You've consistently have been completing contracts above and beyond my expectations. Alright, that's probably enough stroking your ego! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=I'm going to confess, I was a little surprised seeing that report come in from your last contract. You had been doing so well! For now, let's just call it a fluke and focus on the next job, okay? 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=I have to ask - were you as disappointed about that last contract as I was? You had such a good record going! But don't worry. Everyone makes mistakes. It's what we do with those mistakes that matter. It's like that saying - "I'd rather try and fail, than fail to try." 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_001=My records show that you did a great job with that last contract! I personally wanted to say well done. It's that kind of performance that Covalex really loves to see. 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_002=Wanted to take a second to say that you did a stellar job with that last contract and that your hard work is not going unnoticed! 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So, with your recent performance issues, I'm afraid that if you don't turn things around, Covalex will be putting you on a probationary disciplinary period and remove you from active contractor status. But don't worry, this contract is you're chance show us how dedicated you are to meeting Covalex Shipping's high standards. I'm sure you'll do great. 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_002=There's a bit of bad news. I've received notice that your time with Covalex may be transitioning to a less 'active' role. Seems that your track record hasn't been all that satisfactory. Good news is that it's not too late for you to change people's minds! You knock this next contract into the goal, and it'll show you still have some tricks up your sleeves. 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_001=I know it's been a little while since we last spoke, but I'm happy to report that my manager has agreed to allow you to do another 'Evaluation Trial' to regain active status as a Covalex Independent Contractor. I'm a firm believer in giving people another chance to prove themselves, and this is yours! 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_002=I've got some good news. We were directed to go through our probationary contractors list and see if there were candidates who we felt deserved to be reconsidered. You immediately came to mind! What do you say? You ready to wipe the slate clean and give it another try?

Crus_HistMarker_From=Crusader Historical Society
Crus_HistMarker_Text_01=Famed musician Carolyn 'Vortex' Thorson was born here on January 8, 2915. Her family's ship was en route to a nearby outpost when it set down to facilitate her birth. As a teenager, Thorson earned the nickname 'Vortex' for the impressive speed and dexterity she displayed behind the drums. As a founding member of Firmament, she helped redefine popular music, making her the most famous and mimicked drummer in the UEE for over a decade.   
Crus_HistMarker_Text_02=Rayari scientists working here at the Hickes Research Outpost created a revolutionary nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) in 2938. The drug, known commonly as Ceprozin, has become widely used during cybernetic replacement surgeries, providing pain relief and curbing inflammation without any of the side effects common with other NSAIDs.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_03=Here, in 2941, Terra Mills researchers combined Cellin's unique soil composition with genetic augmentation to create a new fruit hybrid named the Terraberry. This uniquely tart, purple berry stays ripe longer than most other berries, making it ideal for interstellar shipping.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_04=Here sits the shelter that saved Bastien Nemitz. In 2930, Crusader Industries hired the noted adventurer to promote the beauty and diversity of their moons by hiking around each one and providing daily updates. Following successful journeys around Cellin and Yela, Nemitz failed to upload a daily diary from Yela on June 24th. A search party was organized but failed to find him. Days later, Nemitz contacted Crusader authorities from this shelter. He'd limped here on a shattered ankle suffering during a terrible fall that also destroyed his mobi. After he was rescued, Nemitz recovered and returned to the Talarine Divide shelter to complete his journey around Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_05=This shelter was erected in part due to the generous contributions of Ethan Halton's friends and families. The large boulders and rocks that dot the Nakamura Valley have made it a popular destination for unregulated open canopy racers. Sadly, in 2917, amateur racer Ethan Halton, unable to handle the track's successive tight turns, died from injuries sustained during a racing crash. To help ensure that other racers would not share Ethan's fate, in 2918, this emergency shelter was erected.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_06=Mario Kosso was the first head of Crusader's emergency response unit. Established to provide support and rescue services to those who found themselves in need on Crusader's moons, Kosso lead the response to the team's first distress beacon, which came from this basin. It was named in his honor upon his retirement in 2938.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_07=The famous picture of Yela's ring illuminated against the darkened sky was taken here by noted photographer Juliana Aston in 2918. The vista became so connected to her artwork that in 2928 it was officially named 'Aston Ridge' in her honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_08=Situated above a junction of multiple canyons, Wolf Point earned its name thanks to Crusader surveyor Cally Stroble who had noted excitedly in her initial report that "Against all odds, it seems a family of wolf-like creatures somehow has found a way to settle the area. Their cries can be heard for kilometers around." However, when further investigation proved that the wolves were merely a prank by a fellow surveyor, the name stuck.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_09=This ridge was named for Crusader's former CEO August Dunlow. Many credit Dunlow's vision as instrumental into transforming Crusader Industries into the company it is today. With that in mind, Dunlow Ridge, with its expansive view of the Daymar landscape, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_10=This section of Daymar became known as Eager Flats after an eccentric artist who called it home. Norman Eager gained notoriety in the 2920s for constructing a series of art installations so massive they could be seen by ships flying above the flats. Deemed 'ephemeral art' by Eager, the pieces were not meant to be permanent. Instead, they were slowly degraded and buried by the moon's constantly swirling sands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_11=The Tamdon Plains were named in honor of Advocacy agent Crista Tamdon, who in 2912 was killed in the line of duty after being ambushed while crossing these plains in pursuit of a suspect.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_12=From 2923 to 2927, a mysterious benefactor took it upon themselves to see that this emergency shelter was stocked with jars of homemade marmalade. First reported by a stranded pilot, as word spread many other travelers would visit the shelter to try the jam for themselves. In 2927, when a reporter attempted to learn who was leaving the sweet treat, the marmalade supply stopped as mysteriously as it began. However, the tradition has been kept alive to this day by the many visitors who continue to leave preserves at the site.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_13=Crusader's former lead ship designer, Shelly Ashburn, became enamored with this location for its picturesque angle of Crusader on the horizon. She often visited the spot to channel her creative energy, earning it the nickname, Ashburn Channel, among her team. Following her retirement in 2940, the site officially adopted the title.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_14=In 2936, Crusader Industries sponsored a competition to find the best travelogue focused on one of their moons. Donnell Flanagan's account of his exciting experiences took top prize and this location, which featured heavily in his adventures, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_15=Crusader CEO Kelly Caplan loved the landscape on this part of Cellin and requested that this ravine be named for her dog, Julep.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_16=Here on August 25th, 2912, Lakedra Walsh organized and won the first ground vehicle race on Yela. The track became famous among ground vehicle racing enthusiasts and subsequently the site of the first official race track on the moon.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_17=On this site in 2906, Darnell Ajay built the first permanent homestead on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_18=On this site in 2906, Phillip Xu built the first permanent homestead on Cellin.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_19=On this site in 2907, Wilma Ivery built the first permanent homestead on Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_20=Advocacy agents, alongside Hurston and Crusader Security forces, pursued Amir Tremaine after he crash-landed into this canyon on Oct. 23, 2929. The wanted fugitive used pieces of his ship to hastily construct a makeshift fortification. Thus began a dramatic, three-day standoff against law enforcement officers which garnered non-stop spectrum coverage up until the final, bloody moments when the Advocacy tried but failed, to take Tremaine alive.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_21=Here on October 2nd, 2904, Chad Fawley ended the first successful solo, circumnavigation of Cellin in a ground vehicle.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_22=In 2934, Esther Hurston was kidnapped and put into a stasis pod by outlaws looking to extract a hefty ransom from her family. The ship holding the twelve-year-old's cryo-pod hid here after its reg-tags were compromised. While one outlaw attempted to procure clean reg-tags, salvager Mac Petrosky discovered the ship. He reported its location and even hid nearby to keep an eye on the ship until authorities arrived on the scene. Petrosky was awarded a Commendation from Crusader Security upon the reunion of Esther and her family.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_23=The infamous Beringer Brothers nicknamed this the "Goodbye Geyser" after repeatedly using it to dispose of those opposed to their criminal enterprises during the early 2920s. It's believed to be the final resting place for at least 14 individuals including famed bounty hunter, Bree Kuznetsov. Attempts to recover remains from the site have proven unsuccessful.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_24=Here in 2909, famed botanist Bryan Shakir began his work cataloguing the diverse flora of Daymar. Published as "Daymar in Bloom: A Flora Field Guide to Stanton 2b," it is still considered by many to be the definitive source on the subject.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_25=Erma Triolo was born on this site in 2909, making her the first person to be born on Yela. Her parents, Albert and Nora Triolo, had traveled to the moon to participate in a race when Nora went into labor. Unable to fly to the nearest medical facilitate for the birth, Albert landed their Constellation at this location and successfully served as midwife.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_26=Prior to Crusader's purchase of the gas giant and its moons, the UEE Navy controlled this part of the system. Here, in 2904, the UEE Navy established a military installation to support and watch over the shipyards perched in Crusader's upper atmosphere. The facilities were retired and relocated in 2908.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_27=Strained relations between Hurston and their workforce in late 2927-2929 resulted in a series of riots. In response, Hurston severely limited traffic to and from the planet for nearly 15 standard months. Many workers wished to escape the dangerous situation, but few had the means. One bright spot was the Hurston Hotline, a comm channel that constantly shifted frequency. Those looking to flee the unrest, and lucky enough to know the current channel frequency, could request help leaving the planet. Specific instructions were delivered in person to volunteer pilots and had to be followed exactly. The network of labor activists responsible for the Hurston Hotline during this tumultuous time used this location to shelter fleeing workers prior to moving them out of the system.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_28=Cellin was named after the youngest sibling in the classic children's story A Gift for Baba,the moon's many dormant volcanoes embodying the character's simmering anger. This dormant volcano, named Cellin's Peak by volcanologists, is carefully watched and monitored as it is believed to have a high chance of one day becoming active. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_29=Daymar was named after the middle brother in A Gift for Baba. Known for his tendency to get lost, the character's name was also given to this twisting canyon by early explorers.

Crus_HistMarker_Text_31=The study of Cellin's geysers began with an observation station constructed on this location in 2908. Geologist Randell Engler spent nearly a decade investigating these natural wonders. He was first to hypothesize that the moon's geyser played an important role in dispersing vital nutrients and minerals into the soil.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_32=During Imperator Costigan's 2944 trip to the Stanton System, he shared a meal here at Gallete Family Farms. Imperator Costigan hoped his visit would draw attention to the hardworking, independent farmers across the Empire that would benefit from the agricultural subsidies legislation being debated by the Senate at the time.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_33=In 2927, Fakih Borisov introduced a herd of large, genetically modified land crabs to Daymar. Breed to withstand the moon's dry conditions, the crabs roamed this part of Daymar for nearly a decade, but Borisov's dream of turning the moon into a rancher's paradise never came to fruition. A key component to Borisov's plan was for the crab to graze on the moon's limited natural vegetation, yet doing so imbued the animals with an off-putting odor that clung to any products derived from them.  
Crus_HistMarker_Text_34=On August 22, 2924, amateur archaeologist Sonny Pak revealed a fossil that he claimed belonged to a new sentient species that inhabited this moon. News of the discovery spread across the spectrum and excited the scientific community. However, instead of allowing scientists to examine the specimen, Sonny took the remains on a publicity tour and even sold tickets to those who wished to view them. His actions were condemned by the scientific community and, after the intervention of the UEE government, the fossil was proven to be a fake.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_35=Romantics believe that lovers who profess their affection for each other on this ledge will be together forever. This legend has its origin in the macabre tale of notorious outlaw couple Akiko 'Jackal' Bazin and Rick 'Shady' Milligan. In 2913, mere moments away from capture, the pair decided to avoid imprisonment and instead leapt to their death while holding hands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_36=On December 31, 2940, the Stanton Knights sataball team landed here so their ship could undergo emergency repairs. While waiting, the team strategized for their championship match against the Kiel Guardians scheduled for the following day. According to team members, it was here that the Knights conceived of the now famous 'Franklin Flip' play that would propel the team to victory and the first SBPL championship in the club's history.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_37=On March 17, 2904, Meiko Norwood collapsed here while loading soil samples into her ship. She passed away later that day due to complications with an artificial heart valve, making her the first person to die on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_38=In 2939, Crusader Security apprehended a fugitive here who was wanted in connection with a massive theft of credit chits. The money wasn't recovered during the arrest, but rumors swirled that the outlaw was in possession of digging implements. Ever since, treasure hunters have flocked here in search of the lost fortune, even though repeated scans have failed to show any sign of it. \n\nCrusader Industries discourages people from digging up the area and asks that any displaced ground be placed back where it came from to preserve the moon's natural beauty.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_39=The long lost Greg Caldwell painting "The Starman's Farewell" was discovered buried underneath a stone cairn on this site in 2908. Stolen from the Terra Museum of Contemporary Art in 2731, it remains a mystery as to how the work of art ended up here. The painting was returned to Terra.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_40=In 2945, independent miner Bruce Amodeo discovered a large serendibite gemstone near this outpost. Its sale at auction to an anonymous buyer broke records for the most credits per carat spent on a serendibite. Ever since, miners have flocked to the region in search of further serendibite deposits.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_41=Tragedy struck the Cuadrado outpost on May 15, 2941, due to a malfunctioning life support system. An excess of oxygen leaking into the outpost was sparked, resulting in an explosion that took nine lives. The catastrophe drove Crusader Industries to tighten regulations on outposts and mandate more frequent maintenance checks on all facilities.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_42=Crusader Industries commends Bountiful Harvest Hydroponics for their extraordinary response to those in need on Vega. Following the horrific Vanduul attacks on October 5, 2945, Bountiful Harvest produced and donated more emergency food supplies for the Vega relief effort than any other outpost on Crusader's moons. This outpost's extraordinary sacrifice serves as a reminder that the UEE will always stand behind those who come face-to-face with the Vanduul threat.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_43=Famed actress and noted naturist, Millicent Silverton, would often come to this remote area to camp in the wilderness. She was so fond of the site that she petitioned for its inclusion in the 2941 film "Onto the Break."
Crus_HistMarker_Text_44=The geysers here feature a unique set of small fissures, that when the pressure builds up to a specific amount, make a sound similar to moaning. It is this phenomenon that has lead to the erroneous rumors that the site is haunted.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_45=In 2932, this site hosted the infamous Slim Chance Rally. This gathering of Greycat buggy enthusiasts come together once a year in a remote location to compete in an illicit destruction derby.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_46=Crusader Industries often uses this location and its irregular terrain to field test their new ship designs' landing systems. It was here on March 25th, 2934, that the first and only landing of the failed Juno ship design occurred.

DXSH_MCAV_Ad_ANVL_Hornet_Commercial=[PH] Legendary Fighter Pilot Area Riley once said Give me a fully loaded Hornet, and I ll shake the gates of Heaven.\n\nAnvil Aerospaces Hornets have faced Vanduul, Shion, Pirates and Criminals.\n\nAnvil Aerospaces Hornets have logged more combat time and kills in more theatres than any other ship in the history of Space Combat.\n\nBattle Tested in the harshest conditions, the Hornet has proven time and again its ability to withstand damage, and still be able to dish it out.\n\nWith all the punishment it handles on a daily basis, don=t you think the new Hornet can handle yours\n\nAnvil s New Hornet F7C, see your authorized ship dealer for options.
DXSH_MCAV_Ad_CNOU_Mustang_Commercial=[PH] We are drawn towards the familiar. It is safe, reliable.\n\nBut it can shackle us to the ordinary when in our souls we long to strike out and become something new.\n\nWe started with a simple match. Dare to dream. Dare to challenge the expectations of what has come before. \n\nTo embrace the Unique, to put everything on the line.\n\nOnly when we risk everything can we discover something truly special, and redefine what it means to drive with the stars.\n\nTo explore the farthest reaches, to race on the cutting edge, to Protect what you love.\n\nSay goodbye to the familiar, and welcome the brand new Mustang, where risk, meets reward.
DXSH_MCAV_Ad_ORIG_M50_Commercial=[PH] Space, the best ships gracefully dance across its expense, the worst clumsily plod across its face. The new M50 doesnt have time for any of that.\n\nInstead, it simply slices its way through.The 2944 M50 was designed with one goal in mind: Make the ship that will win the next Murray Cup.\n\nThe surprising thing is, Origin may have just about done it.\n\nThe stats are an orgy of mind-bending numbers but it comes down to two things. Less weight and more power. Youll notice the nose cone has grown what I can only describe as a mustache, added to stabilize all the additional thrust that the retooled and updated Twin Hammer HM4point3 drives spew out. And the refinement doesnt stop there.\n\nThey ve narrowed the front fuselage, moved the wings forward for better balance, shaved the cockpit viewpane down to the finest it could still be and not shatter in your face.\n\nThe result. A pure flying machine. Each movement on the stick translates directly into unadulterated throttle action. Welcome back to the glory days of flying.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_02=[PH] Damn. How many was that?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_03=[PH] That'll teach them not to bunch together.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_01=[PH] Marine down and in need of medical.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_02=[PH] We've got an injured Marine in need of help.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_03=[PH] Need a medpack, lifesign's critical.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_04=[PH] Marine down. Marine down.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_05=[PH] We lost control of the situation. That can't happen. Next time, we need to focus, and we need to work together. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_01=[PH] That was a complete bloodbath of epic proportions. Consider me dissapointed.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_02=[PH] They completely dismantled our operation six ways from Sunday. We need to be better than that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_03=[PH] What the hell did I just witness? That went about as wrong as wrong can go.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_01=[PH] We got them that time, but stay focused. This ain't over yet.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_02=[PH] And that is how you stop a threat dead in it's tracks. Well done.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_03=[PH] Mark one in the Win column.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_04=[PH] That was one heck of a fight, but don't get cocky. There's plenty more work to do..
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_05=[PH] We put them in their place for now, but that's not going to stop them for long. Just another day on the job. Let's do it again.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_01=[PH] In and out, and not a single Marine down. Couldn't ask for a better op.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_02=[PH] That was near flawlass work, and you all deserve accomendations, but that comes later. Now we need to stay focus, It only takes one lucky shot to change everything.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_03=[PH] All that training really paid off. You put down those outlaws before they even had a chance to know what hit them.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_01=[PH] You waitin' for an invitation?!? Get out there!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_02=[PH] Move out!

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_30_Seconds_Left_02=[PH] Stomp them skags. We're running out of time. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_01=[PH] Don't punk out now.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_02=[PH] Take a breath. You got this.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_03=[PH] It's us or them. Remember that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_04=[PH] You really gonna let some Marines stomp us like that?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_First_Blood_01=[PH] Way to send a message.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_First_Blood_02=[PH] Hit hard and fast, that's what I like to see.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_First_Blood_03=[PH] Bet they weren't expecting that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Gain_Player_01=[PH] Looks like someone finally woke up.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Gain_Player_02=[PH] Got some new blood on the team.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Game_Objective_Briefing_01=[PH] Alright, scumbags, listen up. We got rats in the clubhouse and I need them dead. Every single one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Game_Objective_Briefing_02=[PH] Here's the roll, we got a Marine team breaching. It's you or them.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_01=[PH] Got 'em.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_02=[PH] Tag, you dead.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_04=[PH] Bye, bye.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_05=[PH] That was fun to watch.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_06=[PH] They won't be gettin' up anytime soon.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_01=[PH] Hey, shut up for a second.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_02=[PH] Who's ready to have a little fun?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_03=[PH] Everyone here? Good.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Kill_01=[PH] Got 'em
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Kill_02=[PH] Nice toss.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Warning_01=[PH] Frag! Frag!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Warning_02=[PH] Grenade!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Warning_03=[PH] Run, idiot!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Halftime_01=[PH] We're gonna hit them from a different angle. Get ready.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Halftime_02=[PH] Time to mix it up. Let's go at 'em from the other side.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_01=[PH] Someone totally nicked your kill.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_02=[PH] Clippin' 'em ain't the same as finishing 'em, but it's all the same to me.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_03=[PH] Seems like you couldn't get the job done yourself.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_01=[PH] That's some bloodlust right there.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_02=[PH] Ravenous. I like that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_03=[PH] Don't stop 'til your heart stops beating.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Last_Player_Alive_01=[PH] Take a sec. Breathe. It's you or nothin'.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Last_Player_Alive_02=[PH] Time to hero up.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Confirmation_01=[PH] You set? Let's do this.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Confirmation_02=[PH] Sorted? Good, then rack up.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Selection_01=[PH] Arm up and get set, people. We got some killin' to do.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Selection_02=[PH] Grab what you want, we'll sort it later.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Selection_03=[PH] These are UEE Marines, so pick your load-out carefully.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Lose_Player_01=[PH] Hold on. That son of a bitch skeeved out.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Lose_Player_02=[PH] Wait a second. I lost one of our team.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_01=[PH] You're lucky they killed you because I wanna do so much worse.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_02=[PH] (off-mic) I ain't goin' back! (exchange of gunfire)
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_03=[PH] Go, go, go let's get outta here.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_04=[PH] I set us up, make a perfect plan, and you just had to go and mess it up didn't you?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_05=[PH] Well we got beat, but then again, they're Marines and we're, well, we're us, so its not too big of surprise really.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_01=[PH] That'll teach 'em to try and roust us.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_02=[PH] Scav the bodies. You earned it. Make sure you vent 'em when you're done.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_03=[PH] Fine job, my wonderful scumbags. Those UEE pukes didn't know what hit 'em.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_04=[PH] And that is why we are still here. Who's drinking?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_05=[PH] Trouncing those Marines felt a billion times better than I thought it would. I say this calls for celebration.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_01=[PH] Alright everyone, let's get this done.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_02=[PH] Ghost 'em.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_Countdown_01=[PH] 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Here they come.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_Countdown_02=[PH] We're going in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_Countdown_03=[PH] Give 'em hell in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_01=[PH] Ain't nothing like it, right?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_02=[PH] Drop 'em.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_03=[PH] Good night.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_04=[PH] Who needs a gun, right?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Multi_Kill_01=[PH] That'll hurt their chances.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Multi_Kill_02=[PH] It's nice when they clump together like that, right?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Multi_Kill_03=[PH] Just mowin' 'em down aint't ya.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Need_Medic_01=[PH] One of your people needs some meds.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Need_Medic_02=[PH] Dose 'em and get 'em back on their feet.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Need_Medic_03=[PH] Another one down? Really?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Need_Medic_04=[PH] Will somebody help 'em already?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_One_Enemy_Left_01=[PH] There's one left. Hunt them down.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_One_Enemy_Left_02=[PH] Almost there. Finish them off.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_01=[PH] What the hell? You gotta do better than that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_02=[PH] Fine. They got lucky this time. Load up and hit 'em again.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_03=[PH] Alright, okay... no, we still got this.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_04=[PH] You wanna let those fascist punks walk all over you. Get mad!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_05=[PH] I'm paying you for better. Deliver.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_01=[PH] Jesus, people, I just... I don't even know...
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_02=[PH] These are Marines. Did you think this was going to be easy? You better rack your game up or I'll rack your brain with a pipe.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_03=[PH] Another show like that and I'm gonna get out of here.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_01=[PH] There we go. One down.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_02=[PH] Hell yeah, people. That's what I like to see.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_03=[PH] This is our station!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_04=[PH] You're getting private stock tonight. Keep it up.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_05=[PH] That's one for us.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_Shutout_01=[PH] <laughing> that... <laughing> That was amazing.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_Shutout_02=[PH] That. That. Just keep doing that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_Shutout_03=[PH] There you go, the Empire's finest laid to waste.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_Start_01=[PH] Go get 'em.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_1=[PH] With the Aeros' win that round, this match is one point closer to being decided.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_2=[PH] A decisive round victory for the Aeros as they show what skill and teamwork can accomplish in the battle arena.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_3=[PH] As the Aeros claims the win for that round, they've got to be feeling better about the outlook for this match. Here's hoping that Jata can pull back.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_4=[PH] Jata falls as the Aeros clinch the round.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_5=[PH] Aeros take this one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_1=[PH] The carrier is taken out with a stun.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_2=[PH] With the carrier is stunned you got to ask where their team was on that one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_3=[PH] You get that ball and it is basically like painting a big target on yourself.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_4=[PH] The carrier went for the opening, but wound up with a face full of stun.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_5=[PH] Yeah, that press is going nowhere with the carrier locked.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_1=[PH] Slater Vonn used to say use the electric field like it's another teammate.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_2=[PH] I once saw Soren Redmond score a goal off a field bounce like that.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_3=[PH] Using the field like it was intended!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_4=[PH] I like a player who uses the whole arena. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_5_Angeli=[PH] Angeli's_Jata's going for better ball positioning with a bounce off the field.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_5_Jata=[PH] Angeli's_Jata's going for better ball positioning with a bounce off the field.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Intercepted_1=[PH] Look out. Gotta watch your passways.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Intercepted_2=[PH] Don't control your passes and you're going to lose the ball.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Intercepted_3=[PH] Right place, right time for the interception.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Intercepted_4_Angeli=[PH] A clean snatch. [Jata_Angeli] will be kicking themselves over that one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Intercepted_4_Jata=[PH] A clean snatch. [Jata_Angeli] will be kicking themselves over that one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Intercepted_5=[PH] Beautiful interception.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Kicked_Pushed_1=[PH] Moving the ball physically instead of using your Kagi can be a great way to defend yourself while in possession of the ball.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Kicked_Pushed_1_Alt=[PH] Moving the ball physically instead of using your Kagi can be a great way to defend yourself while in possession of the ball.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Kicked_Pushed_2=[PH] Looks like the ball may have gotten a little away from them there.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Kicked_Pushed_3=[PH] You got to control that ball by AMP. Any means possible.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Kicked_Pushed_4=[PH] Going old school, and physically moving that ball.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Kicked_Pushed_5_Angeli=[PH] Angeli _ Jata move in and knock the ball back.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Kicked_Pushed_5_Jata=[PH] Angeli _ Jata move in and knock the ball back.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Near_Goal_1_Angeli=[PH] Angeli_Jata has the ball in range of the goal.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Near_Goal_1_Jata=[PH] Angeli_Jata has the ball in range of the goal.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Near_Goal_2=[PH] The goal is close. How they choose to score is the big question.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Near_Goal_3=[PH] We're nearing the end of a scoring drive, with the goal in sight.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Near_Goal_4=[PH] I'm seeing the ball very near that goal.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Near_Goal_5_Angeli=[PH] Clever play by Angeli_Jata has put their ball in the right place.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Near_Goal_5_Jata=[PH] Clever play by Angeli_Jata has put their ball in the right place.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Passed_1=[PH] It's important to keep that ball moving.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Passed_2=[PH] Nice pass.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Passed_3=[PH] Right in the pocket, pass complete.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Passed_4=[PH] Showing zero fear with that pass.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Passed_5_Angeli=[PH] A solid throw bypasses the Jata _ Angeli defense.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Passed_5_Jata=[PH] A solid throw bypasses the Jata _ Angeli defense.

There has been a lot of speculation flying as who will take it, but I think to say that whichever way it goes, it's going to be fun to watch. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Both_Sample_01=[PH] CV: Quite a battle going on here.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Defensive_Shooting_1=[PH] Defense showing some strength.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Defensive_Shooting_2=[PH] Nice shot.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Defensive_Shooting_3_Angeli=[PH] Jata _ Angeli really trying to hold the line.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Defensive_Shooting_3_Jata=[PH] Jata _ Angeli really trying to hold the line.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Defensive_Shooting_4_Angeli=[PH] If I was out there I'd be doing just what the Jata _ Angeli are doing. Maintaining the goal with a judicious application of gunwork.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Defensive_Shooting_4_Jata=[PH] If I was out there I'd be doing just what the Jata _ Angeli are doing. Maintaining the goal with a judicious application of gunwork.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Defensive_Shooting_5_Jata=[PH] Jata _ Angeli standing firm in the face of that press.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gain_Possesion_1_Angeli=[PH] A smart play gains Angeli_Jata possession.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gate_Opening_1=[PH] Gates are open!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gate_Opening_2=[PH] I know this feeling well. As those gates open, your heart is beating a million times a minute. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gate_Opening_3=[PH] Gates open and both teams take the field.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gate_Opening_4=[PH] Taking the field can be intimidating, but you need to remember your battleplan, watch where your opponents are positioning themselves.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gate_Opening_5=[PH] Gates are open and here comes the action.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gates_Closing_1=[PH] With the gates starting to close, anyone who hasn't left could be looking at a penalty.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gates_Closing_2=[PH] I'm a little surprised to see that there are some players who have not yet left the gate as it begins to close.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gates_Closing_3=[PH] I see the gates closing which means things are going to heat up.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Gates_Closing_4=[PH] And the gates are shutting. Let's do this.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Attempt_1=[PH] Coming in hot...
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Attempt_2_Angeli=[PH] Angeli_Jata looking to score...
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Attempt_2_Jata=[PH] Angeli_Jata looking to score...
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Attempt_3=[PH] Attempting a goal and...
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Attempt_4=[PH] Lining up the shot...
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Attempt_5=[PH] This is it...
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_1=[PH] Afte a block like that, the shooter has got to be fighting back tears.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_2_Angeli=[PH] Blocked! Jata _ Angeli really stepping up when it counts.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_2_Jata=[PH] Blocked! Jata _ Angeli really stepping up when it counts.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_3=[PH] Smacked back hard. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_4_Angeli=[PH] Denied! Jata _ Angeli are teaching a master class in defense here today.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_4_Jata=[PH] Denied! Jata _ Angeli are teaching a master class in defense here today.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_5_Angeli=[PH] No goal! Angeli _ Jata have to be hurting over that one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Blocked_5_Jata=[PH] No goal! Angeli _ Jata have to be hurting over that one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Missed_1=[PH] Another disappointment!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Missed_2=[PH] No goal! The score'll stay where it is.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Missed_3=[PH] No good - it's wide!
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Missed_4=[PH] Nope, couldn't pull off the goal.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Goal_Missed_5=[PH] A solid attempt, but just not enough to score.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Hattrick_1=[PH] I hope you all appreciate the difficulty of what you just saw. Three goals. Color me impressed.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Hattrick_2=[PH] And that's three goals. That right there is something that every player longs to have in their stats.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Hattrick_3=[PH] That was goal number three. An incredible feat for any Sataball player. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Headshot_1=[PH] Right to the head.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Headshot_2=[PH] This is why it is so important to keep your head protected. Those extra seconds add up.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Headshot_3=[PH] An ugly headshot takes that player out.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Headshot_4=[PH] It's harder shot, but if you can get the head it is worth it.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Headshot_5=[PH] A headshot like that is a spirit breaker.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Long_Pass_1=[PH] Distance and accuracy. A dangerous combination in a passer.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Long_Pass_2=[PH] A lot of teams try to keep their passing game short, I'm a firm believer in spreading out your office and going for those long passes.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Mistake_4=[PH] Rookie mistake.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Mistake_5=[PH] Important thing when you slip is to put it out of your mind and get back in the game.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Sataball_History_Comments_3=[PH] Some have called the Aeros' constant roster rotations as a sign of indecision, but this early in the season, I think they're just testing player combinations, looking for that golden team.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Stunned_3=[PH] A strategic stun. We might start seeing some movement here.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Stunned_4=[PH] When your suit locks up like that, its important to use that time to think strategy.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Close_To_Winning_5=[PH] I'll tell you, Max. Those players on both sides have to know that every single shot and move could be the one that seals this game up.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Comes_Back_From_Deficit_1_Angeli=[PH] [Jata_Angeli] isn't taking it lying down - they're coming back to give [Angeli_Jata] a real match!

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Large_Score_Gap_1_Jata=[PH] Everything [Angeli's_Jata's] doing is working tonight.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Large_Score_Gap_2=[PH] What you're seeing here is simply a breakdown of fundamental mechanics.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Large_Score_Gap_3=[PH] This is a total rout.  I don't see this turning around.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Large_Score_Gap_4_Angeli=[PH] [Jata_The Aeros] just haven't been able to put together any kind of resistance this game.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Needs_To_Turn_It_Around_1_Angeli=[PH] This game is 90% mental. If the Aeros can't get their head in the game, they'll never turn it around.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Needs_To_Turn_It_Around_1_Jata=[PH] This game is 90% mental. If the Aeros can't get their head in the game, they'll never turn it around.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Needs_To_Turn_It_Around_2=[PH] Sometimes a team needs to admit that their initial strategy isn't working and adopt a new one.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Needs_To_Turn_It_Around_3_Angeli=[PH] [Angeli_Jata] need to get angry, get focused, something to snap them out of this skid.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_B_Needs_To_Turn_It_Around_4=[PH] This is where you really get a sense of the character of the team, how do they turn the tables when victory is getting further away?
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_Shutout_1=[PH] The Astros completely owned this game. They seemed to shut down Jata at every opportunity.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_Shutout_2=[PH] Sometimes there are days where everything works and then there are days like today. Jata fell in the latter.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_A_Shutout_3=[PH] The Angeli Aeros absolutely dominated the team from Jata that round. Managing to wipe them out without suffering a single loss.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_Angeli_Aeros_Score_1=[PH] That's a point. It is clear that the Aeros came here to play.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_Angeli_Aeros_Score_2=[PH] With that goal, you have to admire the Angeli for being able to pull the trigger when it counts.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_Angeli_Aeros_Score_3=[PH] That is how you do it. Jata players take note. The Aeros just showed you how it's done.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_Angeli_Aeros_Score_4=[PH] I think that goal was Aero's response to those who said they couldn't make it this far.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_Angeli_Aeros_Score_5=[PH] And it's in the goal! Angeli's got to be riding high after pulling that play off.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_B_Shutout_1=[PH] Jata was really firing on all cylinders in this match. The Aeros could not shut them down.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_B_Shutout_2=[PH] With barely a scratch on them, Jata ZGCC completely shuts out the competition that round.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_B_Shutout_3=[PH] The Aeros close out that round without a single point and their fans have got to be disappointed.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Team_Jata_Zgcc_Score_1=[PH] And it's good. Jata showing some inspired athleticism on the field today.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Teamwork_1=[PH] These are the moments that you live for as a player and a fan, where a team seems to anticipate each other on a subconscious, almost psychic level.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Teamwork_2=[PH] That's what I love, when a team is really in sync, it makes their opponents look hopelessly outclassed.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Teamwork_3=[PH] Some fantastic handling going on, let's see if they can turn it into points.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Teamwork_4_Angeli=[PH] [Jata_the Aeros] have been putting in the hours to train for this match, it's really starting to show.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Teamwork_4_Jata=[PH] [Jata_the Aeros] have been putting in the hours to train for this match, it's really starting to show.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Time_Running_Out_2=[PH] Some players thrive in a time crisis. Let's see if any are playing tonight.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Turnover_1=[PH] Ball turns over. Not a good time to lose possesion. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Turnover_2_Angeli=[PH] Angeli _ Jata has got the ball back. Let's see if they can make something happen.

DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Turnover_4=[PH] Turnovers like that can cost you the game. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Turnover_5=[PH] The great teams don't let turnovers like that slow them down. 
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_1=[PH] A tough loss on that one, let's see if Jata can do better in the next round.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_2=[PH] The round ends in defeat for Jata ZGCC. Hopefully they can pull it together as they prepare to head back out.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_3=[PH] With the loss of their last combatant, Jata is handily defeated that round. I'm sure they cannot be happy about their performance.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_4=[PH] After suffering a defeat that last round, Jata Club will be looking for a way to turn things around.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_5=[PH] Despite some impressive moves from Jata, the Aeros manage to take the round.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Astro_Arena_Comments_1=[PH] These player's have got to be appreciating the recently renovated features here at the arena. New owners AstroArmada have really done wonders updating the facilities to 30th century standards.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Astro_Arena_Comments_2=[PH] Astro Arena used to accomodate live audience viewing boxes just beyond the outer zone of the sphere, but the Banu fans proved to be too disruptive to the game.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Astro_Arena_Comments_3=[PH] Personally I will miss the old barriers, I will not, however, miss the old broadcast booth.
DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Max_Astro_Arena_Comments_4=[PH] Astro Arena is also proud to host professional gravity tunnel racing during the off-season. Something to check out!

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_back_to_baseTraining_1460_Training_Complete_Return_To_Base=Let's get you back to base. First round's on me.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_bad_landingTraining_1010_Landing_Bad_Landing=<sigh> That needs a lot of work.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_executedTraining_0440_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Gilly_Executed=Ah... so much fun.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_explanationTraining_0450_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Explanation=Rolling is a great way to orient your ship to fit through tight gaps or evade incoming fire. Now you give it a go.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_introTraining_0430_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Intro=Moving on. Now this is my favorite part of training: the barrel roll.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_beckoning_playerTraining_0010_Player_Report_To_Leader=Hey there. Hustle on over.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_alt_useTraining_1090_Flight_Boost_Alt_Use=You can also use it to overpower you manoeuvring thrusters in order to take tighter corners.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_introTraining_1080_Flight_Boost_Explanation=If you need to get up to top speed in a hurry, try boosting.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_boost_rechargeTraining_1100_Flight_Boost_Recharge=You do have a limited amount that takes time to replenish, so don't go nuts with it.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_difficultyTraining_0800_Combat_CM_Chaff_Difficulty=Deploying Noise takes more skill than Decoys. To be successful, you need to put it between you and the missile.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_explanationTraining_0790_Combat_CM_Chaff_Explanation=Good. Now, a Noise creates a cloud of electromagnetic interference to mask your signature from the missile.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chase_player_dawdles_1Training_0580_Combat_Chase_Player_Dawdles_01=What are you waiting for? Go finish it off.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chase_player_dawdles_2Training_0580_Combat_Chase_Player_Dawdles_02=Let's go. You're on the clock, rookie.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_comstab_explanationTraining_1170_Flight_Comstab_Explanation=You also have COMSTAB which adjusts your forward velocity so you can make controlled turns. Disabling  COMSTAB will allow you maintain your velocity in turns, but you will drift wider..

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_autoTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Activating landing mode restricts you to decoupled mode, meaning only your manoeuvring thrusters fire, which is handy for precise movement in tight areas.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_manualTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=I've gone ahead and restricted you to decoupled mode, which makes it much easier to position yourself for a launch. In Decoupled Mode, your main engine is disengaged, allowing you to move more precisely using your manoeuvring thrusters.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_modeTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_01=Remember Decoupled Mode from taking off? If the Drone gets behind you, enter Decoupled mode to disengage your main engines and allow you to spin your ship around while retaining your original vector.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_player_tryTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_03=Give it a try, just remember to disengage it when you're done.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_autoTraining_0880_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Remember, entering Landing Mode will automatically Decouple your ship, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad as it cuts down your speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_manualTraining_0890_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=The flight system automatically cuts down on your speed when you deploy the landing gear, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_warningTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_02=It's a great way to dissuade a pursuer, but make sure you've checked your path ahead first.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_deviate_from_landingTraining_0950_Landing_Deviate_From_Landing=If you raise you landing gear or stray too far from the pad, you'll have to request it again.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_disabled_controlsTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_02=You'll notice the majority of your systems are disabled. I'll be controlling when they are on and offline to simulate potential scenarios in combat situations.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_doors_openTraining_0110_Take_Off_Doors_Open=Once you're aligned, the tower will open the doors.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_1_introTraining_0470_Combat_Intro_03=Don't worry - it's just a training drone. It handles just like the real thing, but it's weapons are less lethal. Saying that - they still pack a punch so try not to take any hits you don't have to.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_2_killedTraining_0840_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Player_Kill_Drone=Good kill. We're heading back to the landing pad to restock and refuel for the final part of your training.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_1Training_1410_Self-Destruct_Player_Hit_Eject_Before_Warning=I can't let you eject without initiating self-destruct.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_2Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_01=It's the only thing I can't do it remotely, kid. You have to initiate. Hurry.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_3Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_02=Your plant's leaking radiation. You need to self-destruct now.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_4Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_03=Hit self-destruct, now!

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_durationTraining_0760_Combat_CM_Flare_Duration=Flares have a short lifetime, don't be too quick to fire them.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_explanationTraining_0740_Combat_CM_Flare_Explanation=Last missile was heat-seeking so equip your flares. Helpful tip, don't boost after dropping a flare. Boosted thrusters are much hotter than a flare.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_launch_successTraining_0770_Combat_CM_Flare_Launch_Good=Good.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_free_lookTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_01=Alright. First thing's first, take a look around your cockpit and familiarise yourself with the layout. It's imperative to quickly find and access specific controls. Last thing you want to be doing in a scrap is bringing up the instructions.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_glaive_defeatedTraining_1360_Combat_Vanduul_Glaive_Defeated=Good kill. Glaive's down.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_glaive_idTraining_1330_Combat_Vanduul_Id_Glaive=That Glaive's a recognised Ace, enemy designation is Tank. We're gonna have to work together to take it down.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_gsafe_explanationTraining_1130_Flight_G-Safe_Explanation_01=Still with me, kid? Good job. Now one thing you need to understand, every ship's outfitted with systems to look out for you.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_gsafe_explanation_2Training_1130_Flight_G-Safe_Explanation_02=That last sharp turn you probably felt your ship clamp down on the turn. That's your G-Safe system kicking in, making sure that you aren't taking too many G-forces and blacking out.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_gsafe_explanation_3Training_1130_Flight_G-Safe_Explanation_03=If you need to get that extra edge in turning, you can disable G-Safe, but be warned. An unconscious pilot turns into a dead one pretty quick.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_guns_backTraining_0810_Combat_Guns_Up_Missles_Later=You got your guns back, but I'll need more time to get your missiles up.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_heavy_damageTraining_0300_Take_Off_Heavy_Damage=Ah, don't sweat it, everybody tags their ship the first time. Your ship is still spaceworthy so I we'll just press on.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_leader_player_dawdles_2Training_0050_Player_Dawdles_02=Let's go.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_match_speed_explainTraining_0320_Targeting_Intro_03=When pursuing a target, you'll want to keep your speed  as close to their as possible. Give it a shot. Make sure I’m targeted and hit Match Speed.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_match_speed_target_speedTraining_0410_Flight_Match_Speed_Target_Speed_Change=Remember, this isn't autopilot, so you still have to steer, but you'll notice that once you're locked, your computer will continue to monitor my speed and adjust. It doesn't matter if I speed up slowly…

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_missile_lock_explanationTraining_0660_Combat_Missile_Lock_Explanation=Missile locking sensors are on the nose so keep your target in front of you long enough to lock on.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_multiple_pipTraining_0590_Combat_Hud_Pip_Multiple_Reticles=Notice you have multiple PIPs with varying lag? Each of those indicates a weapon on your ship. The computer's trying to compensate for the varying speeds between your ballistic and energy projectiles.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_new_drone_targetTraining_0710_Combat_New_Drone_Target=Let's move on - uh-oh! Looks like he had a friend. Take a look in your rear-view camera.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_pitch_rollTraining_0160_Take_Off_Pitch_Roll_Warning=Make sure you don't pitch or roll. It'll be tough to get back into proper alignment.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_off_centreTraining_0200_Take_Off_Player_Off-Centre=Don't align yourself with the middle of the doors. You'd be surprised how many 'cruits forget that the cockpit is not the centre of the ship.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_strafe_forwardTraining_0180_Take_Off_Player_Move_Forward=Okay. Now strafe forward onto the taxiway. If you need it, the tower should have lit up your path.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_somedamageTraining_0280_Take_Off_Some_Damage=A little shaky, but vertical take-offs take some practice.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_space_brake_introTraining_1110_Flight_Space_Brake_Explanation=If you need to cut speed in a hurry, use your space brake - it's much quicker than dialing back your engines and the moment you let go of it you'll automatically accelerate back up to your previous speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_spire_fillerTraining_1470_Filler_And_Foreshadow_The_Spire=That, my friend, is the Spire. Isn't she a beauty?

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_hud_explanation_2Training_0490_Combat_Target_Enemy_Hud_Explanation_02=Shields are drawn as panels floating around the ship. They'll shrink as they weaken until they disappear completely. At that point, your shots will hit the hull and cause lasting damage.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_leaderTraining_0320_Targeting_Intro_01=I've just enabled your targeting system. Use it to target me.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_lines_upTraining_0540_Combat_Target_Fire_When_Ready_01=Line up your target and fire when you're ready.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_intro_3Training_1250_Combat_All_Weapon_Systems_Active=This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. All your systems are active. This is a live-fire encounter.

Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_E_Desc_001=A price has been set on the heads of ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). \n\nWhile having to hit two targets isn't that weird, the client wants to send a very specific message, so they need to targets hit at the exact same moment. The extra credits should make up for the hassle.\n\nAnd unfortunately since the pair aren't traveling together, it goes without saying that to pull it off you're gonna need some help. Make sure you bring people you trust can handle more than one ships since the targets are known to travel with backup. \n\n
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_E_Title_001=Double Tap
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_H_Desc_001=Contract's for two targets that need to be taken out at the same time. \n\nGuess the client is worried that if they aren't eliminated together, one of them will go dark and try to get some revenge.\n\nThey go by ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2).\n\nFind yourself a team, divide and conquer.\n\nAnd make sure whoever it is has got skills, because these two have a reputation for holding their own in a fight and they for sure won't be alone. Be ready for them to give you some trouble. 
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_H_Title_001=Two In The Head
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Desc_001=Interesting assignment came my way. I need two separate targets taken out: ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) \n\nProblem is, either one gets word about the other being hit, they’ll go to ground. Can’t risk losing either of them. \n\nIt’ll take considerable coordination, but I want you to hit them both at the same exact time.  \n\nAnd since you can’t be in two places at once, you’ll need to find someone you can trust to help on this.\n\nThankfully, my intel says that both the targets should be traveling alone. That should help make things a bit easier on you.
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Title_001=Coordinated Takedown
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_M_Desc_001=Got a contract to take out two up and comers who've been stirring up trouble. It has to be clean, both done at the same time, or else they might cause even more trouble.  Long story short, you'll need some help on this one.\n\nBoth ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) know how to handle themselves, and the people they fly with aren't no joke either. You can expect each of them to be guarded by a few ships.

Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_S_Desc_001=Normally, the pair of ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) would be too much to take on together. They both are about as good as it gets when it comes to dogfighting and the crew they fly with are almost as good.\n\nBut recently they split - not sure why - and are flying separate for the moment.  Someone thinks this may be the best chance to take them out. \n\nGather some personnel you can trust and plan a simultaneous raid against both targets. It's too dangerous to risk one of them living after such a direct move against them.

You need to enlist a partner to make sure both targets are hit at the same time.\n\nAs far as them putting up resistance, ~mission(TargetName) is known to bring along a friend to watch their back, and I suspect ~mission(TargetName2) will do likewise. 
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_VE_Title_001=One-Two Combo
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_VH_Desc_001=~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2).\n\nTwo serious operators who've recently decided to make a move against their boss.

Ellis13=Pinecone\n
Ellis13_Desc=Though technically not a planet, Ellis XIII is considered a local mascot. This protoplanet's unique shape has given it the nickname Pinecone.
Ellis1_Desc=This protoplanet is a scorched, barren ball of rock and bubbling magma due to its extreme proximity to the star. While the possibility exists that there are major deposits of minerals on the planet, mining them would be far too risky.
Ellis2=Ellis II
Ellis2_Desc=Ellis II's large size, proximity to its sun, and surprisingly thick atmosphere has left its entire surface a massive desert, marked with strange swirls and ridges created by frequent massive storms on the planet's surface.
Ellis3=Green
Ellis3_Desc=The vast oceanic world is mostly known as the primary resort destination for racegoers who enjoy Green's high-end mega-resorts. In an effort to protect the elaborate underwater reefs, ships landing on the planet are directed towards specific landing zones.
Ellis4=Kampos
Ellis4_Desc=Named after the large sea creatures that once stalked its deep oceans, Kampos was the first world settled and continues to boast the highest population center in the system.
Ellis5=Noble
Ellis5_Desc=The emerald jewel of the system, Noble is known for the vast stretches of woodland, evoking many comparisons to an undeveloped Earth. The local Governors Council has made sustaining the planet's natural beauty a priority.
Ellis5a=Ellis 5a
Ellis5a_Desc=The regolith of this moon is slightly pink, making it a popular subject for lunar photography.
Ellis5b=Ellis 5b
Ellis5b_Desc=A tidally locked moon, the planet-facing side is pristine while the star-facing side is pocked with craters. 
Ellis6_Desc=A terrestrial planet located just outside the system's green band. Although the planet is technically uninhabited, Ellis VI has been used to conduct studies about human habitation.
Ellis7_Desc=A corrosive and poisonous atmosphere covers this planet making it impossible to terraform or even land on.
Ellis8_Desc=The smallest planet in the system, Ellis VIII boasts a micro atmosphere and little else.\n
Ellis9=Walleye
Ellis9_Desc=Nicknamed Walleye by long-distance haulers, Ellis IX is a swirling gas giant that intermittently suffers from massive storms visible from space.
Ellis_AsteroidBelt1=Ellis Belt Alpha
Ellis_AsteroidBelt1_Desc=Perhaps the best known asteroid belt in the UEE, the Ellis Belt became famous for being a Murray Cup racetrack. Over the years, the Murray Cup has sought to acquire all rights to the belt, making mining strictly prohibited.     \n
Ellis_Desc=This thirteen-planet system contains a wide habitable zone thanks to its F-type main sequence star. Ellis is mostly known as the home of the UEE's most famous race, the Murray Cup. What began as way to kill time during the terraforming process has become big business; fueling the economy for the three terraformed planets -- Green (Ellis III), Kampos (Ellis IV), and Noble (Ellis V). Ellis' eleventh planet recently collided with its moon, leaving an asteroid belt in the former orbital path.

FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_01=Your loved one has just taken the first step towards a proud life in Naval service. You may have questions about what they will experience in basic training, the safety of your relative/friend, and what kind of contact you can expect during their training and subsequent deployment.\n\nWe know that this can be a scary time for some people and hope that this will offer some piece of mind about the wonderful opportunities that can result from this decision.\n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_02=Standard training begins as the recruits arrive on MacArthur via Naval transport. They are immediately given a choice, known as the Rubicon, which is a final opportunity to reconsider the enlistment. After which, the recruits will be divided into groups and assigned to their training camp, known as a Forge. They will also meet their Divisional Officer who will be their first mentor to train them for Naval Service.\n\nAfter an extended period of intense drilling, physical fitness, and education in military theory and technology, the recruits will transition into the Candidacy phase of their training. During this time, they will undergo a series of physical, psychological, and intellectual tests to determine where in the Navy they would be the best fit for. Some may move to the flight academy, some to research, a few may even be detailed for Marine training.\n\nFrom this point on, the recruit will receive dedicated training into whatever discipline they’ve been selected for. This will account for the remainder of their training and will end with their first ship assignment which will coincide with the next Invictus week unless there is a need for more specialized training. \nAfter that, they will deploy.\n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_03=We understand that the first few weeks away from the recruit are the most difficult for family and friends, but we ask that you refrain from attempting to contact them. \n\nTo help, all recruits will send a comm to let their family know that they’ve arrived on MacArthur safely, but as a common practice, we want to keep the recruits focused on these initial phases of their training as they can be crucial in their development. Therefore, we will restrict any inbound communications until after this blackout period ends. After that, you will be able to contact them on a more regular basis as comm access is a weekly privilege.\n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_04=A Starman’s deployment experience will vary based on their ship assignment and specialty. Many of these can take place far away from active combat zones or in dangerous areas of operations but some of these do end up placing them in harm’s way. You must understand that all of our service men and women will be trained to endure in these high intensity situations.\n\nThe Navy does offer several programs for friends and family who are having difficulty coping with a loved one on deployment, so feel free to contact the outreach department at your local Naval station to speak with a counselor who can walk you through the best options to put you at ease. \n
FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_05=While many of our personnel find that the Navy can offer a complete career, some are happy to take their experience and training back into the private sector as a Citizen. You’ll be pleased to know that honorable service in the Navy opens a variety of opportunities that may not have been available before such as continuing their education on one of the Empire’s many institutions or transforming their newfound skills into a high-paying career in the civilian world.\n\nRegardless of which path they choose, your loved one will be well-equipped to handle all the challenges that life throws at them, knowing that they have loving friends and family like yourselves, and a forever family in the Navy.\n

FleetWeek2950_History_Body_01=The UEE uses Invictus Launch Week as an opportunity to not only congratulate the latest graduating class of starmen and pilots, but also celebrate this newest group of recruits gathering to set off for training. All over the Empire, sons, daughters, partners, brothers, and sisters say goodbye to their loved ones before embarking to MacArthur to start their next journey in life: \n\nThe adventure of service in the UEE military.\n\nDuring this time, Naval vessels dock around the Empire and let the populace see these brave defenders and awe-inspiring ships up close. Invictus is also a wonderful opportunity for the community to come together with local governments, businesses, and law enforcement to talk about planetary security and outreach.\n
FleetWeek2950_History_Body_02=This may come as a surprise, but Invictus actually goes back several centuries to the days when the UEE was known as the United Planets of Earth (UPE). Shortly after the First Tevarin War began in 2541, Humanity suddenly found itself in need of an organized military force at a size previously unneeded. To this point, aside from the hostage situation with the Xi’an in 2530, there had only been local security forces under the control of the central Human government.\n\nWith Humanity facing an imminent and overwhelming threat, a fleet needed to be raised and trained quickly. The Tribunal sent out an immediate call for recruits to create this army.\n\nTransport ships on each of the settled planets would load up these volunteers and travel to a training facility on Mars known as Invictus. \n\nOn the morning of 2542-10-12, families and communities gathered at launch pads around the UPE territories to celebrate those that were going to defend against the alien invaders. As the conflict continued, more recruits would gather on that day to travel to Invictus to begin their training.\n\nOver the centuries, as the Empire has expanded, space travel has become even more accessible and most recruits are able to self-report, the need for Invictus Launch Week’s has diminished. The spirit of it, however, is stronger than ever.\n\nInvictus is a time to celebrate each other. To celebrate bravery, duty, and commitment to the goals that define Humanity at its finest.\n\nWelcome to Invictus 2950.\n

FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_01="To me, it was never really a choice. I know a lot of people grapple with the decision, but honestly, it never crossed my mind. I mean, both my parents got their Citizenship from military service, so maybe that was a factor. There was a moment though when I touched down on the tarmac, I was suddenly seized with this fear that I wasn’t going to be able to be able to make the cut. That was the scariest thing to me; being afraid that I was going to let down my parents and all the people who proudly wore the uniform before me. Thankfully, the Navy isn’t about me. My brothers and sisters built me up and made me the starman that I am today."
FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_02="Growing up, I never really thought that I would be military. I was a rambunctious kid, to put it mildly. Wasn’t great with authority. To be honest, I was on a bad road and by all accounts probably would’ve stayed on it, until a Judge Advocate set me straight instead of sending me to jail. Once I was in, I managed to find the one thing that had been eluding me all my life: a family."
FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_03=“I’m sure you’re talking to a lot of people who joined up wanting to be Aria Reilly or Cal Mason or something, but me? I wanted to learn. To me, all the wonder of the universe was found in nuts and bolts, in shaving fuel efficiency by three percent. That was my rush. If you want to get your hands on the latest in cutting edge technology and work with some of the greatest minds, the UEE Navy is the place to go.”
FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_04=“I’ll just come right out and say it, the second after I signed up, it felt like I got hit by a ship because it was real now. Was I going to have to fight a Vanduul face-to-face? Hell, was I even going to make it through boot? I mean, I struggled to do a pull-up when I was a kid. What the hell was I thinking? Maybe I could try to get out of it. All these thoughts just ambushed me from that moment up to my Invictus. There was this Lieutenant monitoring all the recruits who must’ve seen how terrified I was. I was fumbling with the seat belt when suddenly the Lieutenant was right in front of me. All he said was “Calm down.” I don’t know. It was part consolation, mostly order, but whatever magic he used. It worked. I wasn’t totally calm when I hit my forge, but I found out everybody was freaking out too. That was our first bond.”
