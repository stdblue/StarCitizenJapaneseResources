PU_NTGUIDE01_M_NTG_Announce_Tour_MessHall_IG_001_HelloEveryoneMy=Hello everyone, my name's Lt. Horrigan and as you can probably tell, this is the War Hammer's mess hall. Definitely one of the more popular spaces on the ship, the mess has a fully automated dispensary since we operate on rotating shifts. We have a standard crew complement of sixty-five to seventy and meals need to be available at all times, so we have a culinary team always on duty, ready to lend support. The famous pilot Aria Reilly was once quoted as saying "If you ever want to take the temperature of a ship's crew, spend twenty minutes in their mess." This is one of the main social areas of the ships where crew members from different departments can catch up in their downtime. We also use the mess for social events like birthdays, holidays, and promotions since it's able to hold so many people. Our skipper, Captain Medcalf, is a big believer in casual gatherings in an effort to entrench kamaraderie, so we're in here pretty often. Now you've probably noticed our games in the corner so I'll just address the question that everyone asks: yes, it's pretty competitive. The XO currently has the score to beat. Anyway, I'd like to invite you to have a look around.

PU_NTGUIDE02_M_NTG_Announce_Tour_Barracks_IG_001_HiFolksWelcome=Hi folks. Welcome to the War Hammer. I'm Leading Starman Detmer and this, as you've probably guessed, is one of the two barracks on the ship. I know, I know, you must be thrilled to see where Navy personnel sleep and let me be the first to tell you, it's every bit as exciting as promised. Javelins are pretty great when it comes to the sleeping arrangements as they have enough bunks for the full crew which is amazing because it avoids situations known as 'hot bunking' where you swap out bunks with somebody on the opposite shift. That, is horrible. This one time on my old ship I had to share with this guy who had just the worst smelling socks. I'm talking 'the military could've weaponized it' kind of bad. And I had to try and fall asleep with that stench every, day. So, after that, these bunks are a dream. Actually, I don't think my CO would like me talking about how bad hot bunking is. Maybe just forget I said anything.\n\nAnyway, each one has special slots for personal effects and is capable of sealing up to give you a little privacy as people are always moving around the barracks. Sleeping schedules shift slightly too and they can activate the full crew at a moment's notice if the ship enters heavy combat, so you're always sleeping with one eye open anyway. I mean, we get shorter sleep schedules if we're patrolling in dangerous space, so you're already grabbing sleep when you can. Sorry, I'm rambling. Otherwise... yeah, I'm not sure what else to tell you. This is where we sleep. Not a whole lot of mystery to it. \n\nI hope this has been enlightening. Have a look around if you want, but please don't touch anything in the bunks. This is an active ship and everything in here is the property of the crew, so be cool.
PU_NTGUIDE02_M_NTG_Close_Tour_Almost_IG_001_LooksLikeWere=Looks like we're wrapping up for the day. You should take off.

PU_NTGUIDE03_F_NTG_Announce_Tour_Turret_IG_001_AllRightLets=All right, let's settle down. My name's Lt. Commander Aldeman, I run the turret complement aboard the War Hammer. That means I'm in charge of coordinating fire between our various gunners during a combat engagement in order to maximize combat effectiveness. But, when we aren't in combat, I strive to keep my team sharp by running through engagement drills and simulated encounters. Now the Javelin comes standard with fifteen turrets, thirteen of which have embedded operators. There are six turrets like the one you see here that run along the side of the ship. Each of which is equipped with a pair of Size 7 cannons for larger targets and a pair of Size 4 gatlings for smaller targets like fighters and even incoming missiles and torpedoes. We've got four more turrets on the bow of the ship, armed with Size 7 energy cannons and three gunners on the underside with the same. All this firepower is coupled with a heavy payload of ordnance to make the War Hammer a real problem for all sizes of ship, hence why we can be tasked to operate independently on patrols without support from the rest of the battle group.\n\nDuring the XenoThreat incursion, our gunners were responsible for the destruction of over seventy hostile elements and several capital ships as well as protecting the ship from incoming ordnance.\n\nAs a special treat, we've safetied this turret so you can get a taste of what it feels like to be a gunner. All the weapons have been deactivated so don't worry about accidental discharge, but I'll remind you this is an active military vessel, so be respectful all the same. Thank you and have a great Invictus.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_003=[PH] As much as I love watching a skilled pilot win, I love a good underdog story even more. So know that even though you might be at the back of the pack right now, I'm pulling for you.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_004=[PH] You may not be winning this thing, but that don't mean you should go out quiet. Hell, if you're gonna lose, you might as well go down swinging, right?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_FewRacersLeft_IG_001=[PH] The competition has narrowed and now we get too see what the last few bangers can really do.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_FewRacersLeft_IG_002=[PH] Only a few contenders left. Let's see who can go the distance.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_FewRacersLeft_IG_003=[PH] That's it. The herd's been thinned out. We're down to the final few.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IG_001=[PH] Man, can I just say that I love this race. Talk about beauty in chaos.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IG_002=[PH] I don't know how many of these races I've seen, but they just never get old. Give me speed and bullets any day.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IG_003=[PH] You know what this race is? This right here is some damn fine entertainment, if I do say so myself.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IG_004=[PH] Just wanna take a second to drop some real respect to our racers today. Not all of you may be that good or really have a shot at winning, but you still showed up and that says something.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_001=[PH] This race is turning into a real shooting gallery. Is there a sale on ammo or something?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_002=[PH] This is some serious bloodlust happening right now. I ain't complaining though.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_003=[PH] Now, I'm not one to judge, but it feels like there are a lot of aggression issues being worked out right now.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_004=[PH] There's something about skilled pilots really going for each other's throats that just does it for me.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_001=[PH] Here we go. Last lap. It's now or never.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_002=[PH] This is the final lap right here. Time to ride or die, people.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_003=[PH] Final lap. Make it count.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_004=[PH] Last lap. It's all or nothing.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_First_IG_001=[PH] First lap's done.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_First_IG_002=[PH] One lap done. Let's keep it going.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_First_IG_003=[PH] There we go. First lap done and done.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_001=[PH] That is another lap complete.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_002=[PH] That lap is done.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_003=[PH] Lap complete. Let's do it again.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_004=[PH] Another lap finished.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_001=[PH] Our fearless leader just cleared another lap.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_002=[PH] This race is one lap closer to completion.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_003=[PH] Look at that. The head of the pack's onto a new lap.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_004=[PH] The number one racer notched another lap.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_SingleRacer_IG_001=[PH] That's another lap complete for our lone surviving ship.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_SingleRacer_IG_002=[PH] And our one remaining competitor finishes another lap.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_SingleRacer_IG_003=[PH] With only one racer left, basically every lap they finish is a victory lap.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_001=[PH] Okay... looks like we got some assholes crashing our race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_002=[PH] Seems we've got some uninvited guests screwing up our race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_003=[PH] Heads up racers, looks like some blinders have decided to use you for target practice.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_001=[PH] Well, if I'm doing my math right, there's only one pilot left. So as long as they don't blow themselves up, the race is theirs.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_002=[PH] With only one survivor left, the finish is theirs for the taking. Piece of advice, don't get cocky. I've seen some crazy shit happen when people drop their guard.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_003=[PH] All right, we got good news and bad news. Good news for our last remaining pilot, you're all that's left, so you pretty much won. Bad news for everyone else who enjoys exciting races because... well see the good news. Someone wake me when they finish.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_Blowout_IG_001=[PH] This is getting to be a blowout. They are just dominating.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_Blowout_IG_002=[PH] If somebody doesn't step up soon, this race is over.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_Blowout_IG_003=[PH] Talk about an absolute beast. I don't know if anyone can catch them at this point.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_001=[PH] This is getting down to the wire. It's anybody's win for the taking now.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_002=[PH] Ooo, we got ourselves a real competition today. Don't know who's gonna snatch the prize.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_003=[PH] I tell you what. This is it right here. This is the kind of race you dream about. Whoever wins is really earning their keep, today.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_001=[PH] Getting close here. A little longer and it's gonna be all over. Question is, the rest of you just gonna let 'em win?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_002=[PH] This could be it. We could be looking at a winner here. That is of course unless someone steps up and stops 'em.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_003=[PH] We headin' into the final moments of the race. If you've been biding your time, now might be the time to make your move.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_001=[PH] And our first racer is down. Was just a matter of time until things got real.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_002=[PH] Mark that as the first kill of the race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_003=[PH] We got a casualty, folks. It's a fight now.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_004=[PH] Someone wanna call a medic? We got ourselves the first casualty.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_005=[PH] Ohhh, racer down! I don't think they're getting back up.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_001=[PH] Aaaand that's another racer down.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_002=[PH] And another racer bites the dust.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_003=[PH] Got another pilot merging with the infinite.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_004=[PH] Another one down. We're getting into a downright brawl here.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_005=[PH] Y'all see that fool go down? Damn they got lit up.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_001=[PH] [ Laughing ] Oh, damn. I bet they thought they were gonna win.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_002=[PH] Oh! They thought they were on top! That they were untouchable, but that dream came crashing down.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_003=[PH] One second they're in the lead, and the next they're a flaming wreck. That's life for ya.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_001=[PH] Kill the leader, become the leader. There can be only one!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_002=[PH] Cycle of life here, people. It's all about killing your way to the top.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_003=[PH] Not only did that racer just kill their way into first place, but they did it with serious style.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_001=[PH] Um... a pilot just left in the middle of the race. What's the point of starting something you ain't gonna finish?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_002=[PH] One of our racers just up and quit... That's a bit dissapointing.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_003=[PH] Seems one of our pilots ran away. Hope no one was betting on them.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_004=[PH] Did y'all see that pilot leave? Thought it went without saying, but don't leave in the middle of a race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_001=[PH] First checkpoint down. Let's see if they can make it two.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_002=[PH] First one's down. We're off, people.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_003=[PH] Alright, alright. Here we go. First checkpoint.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_001=[PH] Checkpoint taken.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_002=[PH] Look at that, another checkpoint down.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_003=[PH] A pilot just snagged another checkpoint.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_004=[PH] Another chekpoint taken. NIcely done.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_005=[PH] Checkpoint claimed. That's what I like to see.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_006=[PH] There we go. Give that pilot a point.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_001=[PH] Looks like we got ourselves a new leader.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_002=[PH] This ain't over yet. New leader's stepping up.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_003=[PH] Hoowee, there's a new boss in town.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_001=[PH] And checkpoint. Not a real surprise there.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_002=[PH] (snore interrupted) Huh? What happened? Oh...
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_003=[PH] One last racer, one more point.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_001=[PH] Get ready. Here comes the next marker.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_002=[PH] Ready up! New marker inbound.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_003=[PH] Ready or not, next marker's coming.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_004=[PH] Another marker incoming. Get ready.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_005=[PH] Hold on, got a new maker on it's way.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_006=[PH] Okay y'all, new marker's about to drop.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_007=[PH] Here comes the next marker.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_WrongWay_IG_001=[PH] I'm normally in favor of an independent streak, but flying the wrong direction is a bit much.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_WrongWay_IG_002=[PH] Not sure if you just missed the signs, but you're heading the wrong way.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_WrongWay_IG_003=[PH] Not sure what "race enhancers" you're on, but you're flying the wrong direction.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_High_IG_001=[PH] That is it! It's all over! We have a winner!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_High_IG_002=[PH] And it's official, we have ourselves a winner!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_High_IG_003=[PH] Stick a fork in it! We have a winner!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_Low_IG_001=[PH] And that's that. To the winner: Congrats. To everyone else: practice.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_Low_IG_002=[PH] And... we're done. All right, let's get ready for the next one. Okay?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_Low_IG_003=[PH] That'll do it. Helluva show from our winner... probably too good of one if you ask me. But nice work.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_001=[PH] I'll see you next time, ladies and germs. Remember, keep the throttle down and your eyes open. Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a bottle of Rust with my name on it.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_002=[PH] Like to thank everyone listening. Keep at it and maybe next time it'll be you in the winner's circle. This is Nas Calloway signing off. Now if you'll excuse me. I gotta take a leak. Later.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_003=[PH] Whew! Don't know about you but I am wiped. Before I head out, a shout out to our new champ and a big thanks to everyone else for making them look so damn good. This is Nas Calloway. I'll see y'all at the next one.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_004=[PH] That's it for me. Win or lose, hope you all had as much fun as I did. Though I'm guessing it's a lot more fun if you win. If you come back and race again, maybe you'll get to find out for yourself. 'Til then, keep it tight.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_005=[PH] Let me be the first to say congrats to our victor. And to all the others, hopefully, I'll see you all back here again real soon. It's been a trip.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_001=[PH] Seems one of our racers had a change of heart and ghosted. But hey, there's always other fish in the sea, right?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_002=[PH] Well, we're down a entrant now. Guess some people can't handle the pressure. Screw it. Race's probably better off without 'em, anyway.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_MinRacersAccepted_IG_001=[PH] What's up, people. Looks like we got enough racers to make this official. Now we just need people to show up and we can get this show on the road.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_MinRacersAccepted_IG_002=[PH] Quick update, ladies and germs. We got enough racers to make this interesting. Once all our people show up, we go.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_MinRacersAccepted_IG_003=[PH] Got word from on high that the race ticket's filling up. I expect they'll be making their way over here any time now. Lookin' at the list... yeah, I think this'll be good.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceAccepted_LongWait_IG_001=[PH] Hey there, stranger. Heard you're gonna be taking part in our little... event. My name's Nes Calloway, I'm gonna be running the show. You should have the rendezvous point in your system, so head on down and we can get this started.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceAccepted_LongWait_IG_002=[PH] What's up. Word is you're ready to turn and burn. That's what I like to see. I'm Nes Calloway, I'll be calling the race. Still waiting on a couple other candidates, but head on over to the start line when you can.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceAccepted_LongWait_IG_003=[PH] Hey. <pause> You reading me? <laugh> Name's Nes Calloway. I'm running the race you just signed up for. Master of cermonies if you like. Sent you a rendezvous spot for your starmap. Head on over.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceAccepted_ShortWait_IG_001=[PH] What's going on, my friend. Nes Calloway here. My people tell me you're up for our next race. We're about ready to go, so head on over to the start line.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceAccepted_ShortWait_IG_002=[PH] Who's ready shred some speed records? Hey, what's going on, I'm Nes Calloway, overseer of the race you just signed up for. Why don't you head on down to the rendezvous and we'll get this show on the road.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceAccepted_ShortWait_IG_003=[PH] Yo, yo, yo. Nes Calloway here. I'm gonna be calling the race you just signed up for. We're about ready to go, so head on over to rendezvous spot pronto and we'll get this thing poppin'.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceCanceled_IG_001=[PH] That's it. I'm calling it. Race is canceled. No point in doing this if no one else is coming. Maybe next time.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceCanceled_IG_002=[PH] Alright, look. I hate to do it, but I got a bunch of pilots who bailed, so it looks like we're gonna have to race some other time.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_001=[PH] Actually, I might kick this off a little early.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_002=[PH] I'll be honest, I'm kinda eager to get this show on the road.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_003=[PH] It's looking like we might be all set to go. Just gonna do a last count...
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_001=[PH] Stay frosty, y'all. Shouldn't be too much longer now.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_002=[PH] Just a couple more ticks, and we'll be ready to go.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_003=[PH] I know y'all wanna get this poppin' but it's gonna be a little bit longer.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_001=[PH] Welcome, welcome. We're still waiting on a few more stragglers, so hang out for a sec. We'll get going soon.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_002=[PH] Hey there, rambler. Welcome to the heat. Bet you're itching to get started, but I'm gonna need you to just sit tight 'til the rest of the racers show.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_003=[PH] Hey, glad you could make it. More food for the fodder, right? As soon as the rest of the pack shows, we'll get going, but 'til then just stay close and be ready.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_ShortWait_IG_001=[PH] Hey there. Just in time. We're about ready to start the race, but we got a few more racers on their way. Cool your jets and once they show, we go.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_ShortWait_IG_002=[PH] Welcome to the show. The race'll be starting soon. Just waiting on a few more people to show.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_ShortWait_IG_003=[PH] Salutations. Thrilled you made it out. Once the rest of the racers get here, we'll kick things off, but feel free to size up the competition till then.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_Countdown_GetReady_IG_001=[PH] Get ready ...

PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_Countdown_Init_IG_001=[PH] You better get those engines humming 'cause we're about to kick off ?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_Countdown_Init_IG_002=[PH] Lock it in, people. It's that time. Time to see who's gonna lay it all on the line and snatch the ring of victory. You ready? You ready? Well ?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_Countdown_Init_IG_003=[PH] Okay. It's that time, people. Time to see who's got the mettle and who's got the grind ?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_Countdown_ReadInFull_IG_001=[PH] You better get those engines humming 'cause we're about to kick off. Get ready ... get set ... go!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_Countdown_ReadInFull_IG_002=[PH] Lock it in, people. It's that time. Time to see who's gonna lay it all on the line and snatch the ring of victory. You ready? You ready? Well, get ready ... get set ... go!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_Countdown_ReadInFull_IG_003=[PH] Okay. It's that time, people. Time to see who's got the mettle and who's got the grind. Get ready ... get set ... go!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Normal_IG_001=[PH] Okay. Everyone's at the starting line, so it's almost go time. Here's the rub. To win, you gotta be first to finish all the laps. Tricky part is all the other racers trying to do the same. Make sense?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Normal_IG_002=[PH] Looks like we got all our racers in place so let me tell you how this is gonna work. The first ship to complete all the laps wins. Easy as pie.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Normal_IG_003=[PH] Alright, ramblers, let's get rambling. Y'all know the drill, the racer that finishes all the laps first wins. Should be a real good time.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Scramble_IG_001=[PH] Alright, listen up. Now that everyone's here, lemme lay out the rules. Y'all are gonna be racing in a scramble. First one to collect enough checkpoints wins. Outside of that, do whatever the hell you want.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Scramble_IG_002=[PH] We're good to go, people. Now the race of the day is what's called a scramble. First one to collect enough checkpoints wins. Anyone get's in your way? Do what you gotta do to get them out of your way.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Scramble_IG_003=[PH] Attention all pilots, we're about to get underway. Now, today's race has two rules: 1. Be the first to collect enough checkpoints. 2. Stop other people from collecting checkpoints. Simple, right?

PU_RUTO_MG_Mission_Greetings_Imperator_IG_002_HeyIWas=Hey, I was just thinking, if I comm'd a general or someone looking like this, do you think I could get them to bomb someone for me? You gotta figure they'd rather blow up some randos than piss off the Imperator, right? I'm gonna try it later, see what happens. Anyway ...
PU_RUTO_MG_Mission_Greetings_StillMission_IG_001_YouHaveYour=You have your instructions. I don't know what you're doing here.

PU_RUTO_MG_RequestNewMission_Searches_IG_003_IMight=I might...
PU_RUTO_MG_SendingMissionDetails_IG_001_HereCheckIt=Here, check it out.
PU_RUTO_MG_SendingMissionDetails_IG_004_UploadingTheDetails=Uploading the details now.
PU_RUTO_MG_SendingMissionDetails_IG_007_ThisContractExplains=This contract explains the rest.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_AllRightSo=All right, so here's the deal. Got word that a facility is gonna be getting timed intelligence drops from their mainframe. You get ahold of these parcels, you can offload them to any number of infoagents in the area. Just watch your back though, you aren't the only person who's been interested in this.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoThanks=It's Ruto. Thanks for the payment. I sent the details to your mobi, but the more you know, right? Anyway, location I sent you is the site of timed data drops. If you secure the server and get ahold of this intel, you can sell it off. The more you get, the more you can make. I know other fixers are selling this tip, so expect company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, the location I sent you is a server that's scheduled to start doing timed data drops. Now, I'm told that the site will be empty until much later, so you've got plenty of time to get in there and secure as many of these drops as you can. Just keep an eye out, you're not the only person I sold this info to.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereGot=Hey there. Got your payment. I sent you the details but here's the deal, a runner I know confided in me before he ran out of breath about a production lab that's set to start processing some drugs. The thing's fully automated and left alone, so anything that comes out's ripe for the taking. Now, I'm not sure how many other people may know about this, so you'll need to move quick and grab what you can.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ThanksForThe=Thanks for the creds, so I'm gonna deliver on my end. Got word that a drug lab's gonna start spitting out packages and there's no one there to watch it which pretty much sounds like a free-for-all to me. You got the location so have at it. Whatever you can get out of there with is yours. You can burn it, sell it, dump it into the sun for all I care.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IJustSent=I just sent you the location of a drug lab that's about to turn into a goldmine. Whoever runs the place just started production on a slew of drug packages and left the place unguarded. I'm not gonna lie, it'll probably be a bloodbath, but you can offload whatever drugs you manage to score. Have fun.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Looks like Crusader found the main Nine Tails fleet. I need you to go and keep those security and mercs off them until the Nine Tails finish up whatever the hell it is they're doing.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhyHelloThere=Why hello there. Ruto here. So here's the deal, Crusader ended up cracking the location of the Nine Tails fleet. They still have some shit they're trying to do, so I need you to tie up those Cru Sec pukes and their mercenary flunkies for as long as possible until the Nine Tails finish up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_WhatsUpKiller=What's up, killer. It's Ruto. Thanks for lending a hand. In case you're totally in the dark, and don't read your contracts, Crusader Security have dispatched a bunch of mercs to where the Nine Tails are broadcasting their quantum dampening field from. I need you to hold them off until the Nine Tails finish up whatever the hell it is they're doing and get out of there.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, Nine Tails is currently running their little quantum blockade thing which is causing all sorts of chaos for me. You see, Crusader's sending out scanning ships to try and find Nine Tails, but they're getting uncomfortably close to uncovering my operations. In short, I want you to track down the Crusader scanning ships and take them out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereNine=Ruto here. Nine Tails are desperate to keep this quantum blockade up for a while longer. Crusader's sent in a bunch of scanning ships to flush them out, but I'm a little worried they're gonna blow up some of my spots, so I'm gonna need you to stop that. Take out as many scanning ships as you can.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HiThereIts=Hi there. It's Ruto. So here's the deal, Crusader scanning ships are out there trying to blow up the Nine Tails' little quantum blockade, but unfortunately they might stumble across some of my operations. That, I can't have, so get in there and take out as many of them as you can. Have fun, tiger.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. So I got word that a medlab's going to be producing some packages of medicine at regular intervals for a limited time. If you can secure the area, grab whatever packages you can, and get out, then you can sell it any number of places. Watch out though. From what I gather, this isn't exactly classified information.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoGot=It's Ruto. Got your payment, so I figured I'd give you the platinum service. Here's the deal, contact of mine said a production facility's going to be churning out some medicine. You should watch out though. With a premium on this kind of medicine, you can be sure that other people will be trying to boost it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, the data I sent you is the location of an automated production facility that's about to start churning out batches of medicine. You get there and secure it, all the batches that come out are yours for the taking. I've been hearing rumbles that this isn't exactly proprietary knowledge, so expect some company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_WhyHelloThere=Why, hello there. I sent the details to your mobi, but here's the jist. That location's gonna temporarily turn into a hotspot. If you get in and get out, there's real money to be made, just watch your back in there.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereGot=Ruto here. Got your payment. Everything you need to know is in the message I sent you. You've only got a limited time to get there and secure the site before there isn't anything left to steal, but understand, you'll probably have some competition, so good luck.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoGot=It's Ruto. Got your credits. You should have all the details, but figured I'd give you a head's up. This is only going to last for a little while, so make sure you head out sooner rather than later. Just got word that some other fixers have been selling this info, so you'll probably have some company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ItsRutoYou=It's Ruto. You should have all the info you need to get going. Just wanted to let you know about a couple things: a) whatever you're able to steal, there are people out there looking to buy. B) This is only going to last for a little while. Lastly, you're probably gonna have some competition out there, so make sure you're armed.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereRuto=Hey there. Ruto here. I sent you all the intel to knock out this job, but thought you should know. People have been selling info about this job to other operators, so you're most likely gonna have some company down there. I'd head down there sooner rather than later and secure the site. That bit of advice is free.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_BlackMarket_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. If you're looking for a spot to offload the stuff, I got word that a contact on the Black Market's paying primo creds for it. Something to consider.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_BlackMarket_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhatsUpIts=What's up. It's Ruto. Not sure if you've already got a buyer in mind, but if you don't, I happen to know someone on the black market who's paying a premium for any stuff you swipe. I'll send the details. That tip's on me.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_GrimHEX_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsMe=Hey, it's me again. Not sure if you've boosted anything yet, but I just got word that there's a very motivated buyer on Grim HEX who'll paying way over market value. That tip's free.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereKiller=Hey there, killer. FYI, I happen to know someone who's very eager to get their hands on any product from that site. It's your call, of course, I'm just a humble fixer, looking to establish meaningful financial relationships. You've got the details. Do with them what you will.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just in case you manage to swipe some product without catching a bullet to the dome for your trouble, a contact of mine is willing to pay a premium for anything you can get out of there. I'll send you the data. Hit 'em up if you're interested.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_SoListenIm=So listen? I'm not sure if you've already got a plan for any stuff you boost, but if you're looking, I have a contact who's paying top creds for the stuff. I'll send you the location details... this is Ruto, by the way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_YouReallyGotta=You really gotta finish what you start. Even letting one of those scan ships survive just means that Crusader's that much closer to finding the Nine Tails.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereIll=Ruto here. I'll admit, I was a little bummed out you weren't able to take out all those Crusader ships. To be fair, they only learned more info about Nine Tails, not me, so I wasn't that bothered, but still? it's sad.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_UhOhLooks=Uh oh. Looks like those scan ships were able to get more intel about the location of the Nine Tails fleet. Sucks for them?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereCan=Ruto here. Can I just say, it's awesome seeing your handiwork when you're on. Crusader's gonna have a helluva time trying to find the Nine Tails when all their ships are vented. Keep it up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_NiceJobBlasting=Nice job blasting all those scan ships. I'll be sure to let the Nine Tails know you're keeping Crusader off their tail. Or tails.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IReallyLove=I really love this spirit of unlawful camaraderie. Even though I'm in the clear, here you are, waxing Crusader security pukes to help keep them off the Nine Tails. It's really? it's really something?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereI=Ruto here. I just got word that my buyer closed up shop. Maybe next time, huh?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyBadNews=Hey, bad news. My buyer's not taking anymore merch.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just heard my buyer closed up shop so you might need to offload your merch somewhere else.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_ItsRutoSo=It's Ruto. So that thing we talked about? Yeah, it's over, so you missed it. Next time maybe?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Seems like you lost interest in that little job I told you about, but the thing's over anyway. So? yeah? I guess you missed out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoWord=It's Ruto. Word is that the job I talked to you about earlier? Yeah, it's over. Maybe next time, huh? Oh, it probably goes without saying, but I don't do refunds.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsMe=Hey, it's me. Just got word that there aren't gonna be anymore drops. You can stick around if you want, but it'll just be for the fun of the kill.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereNot=Ruto here. Not sure if you're fighting anyone right now, but a contact said that the site isn't gonna be spitting out any more drops, so you might as well bail.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Got a hit that there aren't gonna be any more drops from that site, so I'd get out of there and sell whatever you got.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyNineTails=Hey, Nine Tails are pulling out. Crusader and their mercs were causing too much damage. I'd lay low if I were you. They're pretty pissed.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoLooks=It's Ruto. Looks like Crusader pushed out the Nine Tails. From what I hear, they're furious about losing their blockade. Anyway, expect things to get bloody.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Nine Tails are pulling out of the area because of those security punks and their mercs. Apparently this whole blockade was a smokescreen for something else they were doing  and they didn't get to do it. Anyway, word just got back to me that they're fuming.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just got word that Crusader managed to lock down the location of the Nine Tails fleet, but in worse news, those assholes stumbled across one of my side hustles. Next time, when I tell you to blast scanning ships, you blast more scanning ships.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhatTheHell=What the hell? When I hire you, I expect you to do the job I hired you for. Now those Crusader security dipshits are all over the Nine Tails' fleet and messing up another one of my operations. Get your shit together? (Pause) This is Ruto.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoGotta=It's Ruto. Gotta say, I'm a little pissed you weren't able to take out those Crusader security idiots fast enough. Now a couple of my businesses have become little more public than I would like. They also figured out where the Nine Tails are broadcasting their quantum dampening from, so you basically screwed up on two fronts. Helluva job.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyLookWhen=Hey, look. When I said I need those scan ships destroyed, I didn't think I was being cryptic. Take this as a learning opportunity: get better. Or get lost.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereI=Ruto here. I hired you to do a job, so you better start doing it. I better hear about a whole graveyard of scan ships at the next scan point.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. I'm still trying to get my operations out of the line of fire, so stop letting those scan ships live. That is what I'm paying you for.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_YouGottaGet=You gotta get your head in gear and do the job I'm paying you to do. I need those scan ships dusted before they expose facets of my operation that I would prefer to remain hidden. That clear enough for you?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_LetsTakeA=Let's take a moment and recognize that you are not holding up your end of the bargain here. I need those Crusader ships dusted before they finish their scans. Internalize that and don't screw up again.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Remind_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyJustWanted=Hey. Just wanted to remind you that my buyer's still looking to take whatever you stole off your hands. If you're interested?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Remind_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereMy=Ruto here. My buyer's still paying out for any product you boosted.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Remind_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsRuto=This is Ruto. Not sure if you forgot, but my buyer's still fiending to buy everything you stole. Make sure to hit 'em up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_HighSales_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. My buyer dropped me a comm to say that you sold off a bunch of merch. Seems you made quite the score.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_HighSales_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoJust=It's Ruto. Just got a really enthusiastic call from my buyer. Seems you made quite the impression.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_HighSales_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. Just heard you made a monster sale to my buyer. Make sure to buy yourself something nice.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto. Just heard you made some creds. Glad to see we could work something out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereMy=Ruto here. My contact said you just dropped by and sold some stuff. I'm not expecting a tip, but you know? a little courtesy goes a long way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoMy=It's Ruto. My buyer was real pleased with the merch your dropped off. Keep it up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereChamp=Hey there, champ. Nine Tails finished whatever it is they were doing. Nice job keeping those Crusader hacks off their back.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HiyaItsRuto=Hiya. It's Ruto. Looks like Nine Tails are pulling out of the system. They're jazzed, so I guess their quantum blockade must have been a success. Score one for the good guys.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_WhosMyFavorite=Who's my favorite operator? Helluva job protecting that Nine Tails fleet. They took care of everything they needed to do and Crusader are left looking like a bunch of dopes. So a good day for everyone.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. Got some good news and bad news. Bad news is that those scanning ships seem to have found the Nine Tails fleet. Good news is you did a helluva job keeping Crusader off my back. So that's cool. Thanks.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoMiss=It's Ruto. Miss me? Anyway, you did a great job distracting Crusader long enough for me to shuffle some of my operations around. So good job. Unfortunately, they also found the Nine Tails which is less cool, but hey, shit happens. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_YouCopyIts=You copy? It's Ruto. Thanks for taking out those Crusader ships. I was able to make some moves to keep them from finding out some of my less hidden operations. On the flip side, I guess they dug out the location of the Nine Tails fleet, so that sucks?for them.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoAgainHelluva=Ruto again. Helluva job burning those Crusader ships. Keep an eye out in case any more scanning ships show up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_002_HiyaImBack=Hiya. I'm back. Heard you dusted a handful of those Cru Sec ships. I appreciate it. I assume Nine Tails are pleased as well. Anyway, keep an eye out for any new scanning ships arriving. (pause) This is Ruto, by the way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_003_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just wanted to say you did a bang-up job dusting those security pukes. Make sure you do the same if Crusader sends out some replacements. Keeping them off of Nine Tails also keeps them off of me, which is pretty great. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_004_RutoHereThanks=Ruto here. Thanks for wrecking those scan ships. Should definitely give me a little more time to make some moves. You should stick around in case any more show up or hunt down more of them. Both would be great. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto again. I like what you did to those Crusader security ships. Very efficient. Gonna help me loads to keep the law away from my little operation. I'm sure the Nine Tails will be thrilled too. Feel free to keep hunting down any more scan ships. Ruto out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto. Just wanted to let you know, I made some moves, reshuffled some hustles, and got my business squared away. By all means, feel free to keep wiping out Crusader scan ships. I'm sure the Nine Tails would appreciate the help.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoAgainThanks=Ruto again. Thanks for holding off those Crusader dopes. My shit is now officially in order, so we're good. If you wanna keep blasting them, and who doesn't, keep doing what you're doing. Nine Tails still got their thing going on, so I'm sure they'll be all for it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_MyHeroGreat=My hero. Great job distracting those Crusader ships long enough for me to reshuffle my operations. They can scan all they want now and they won't find anything. Of mine, at least. But hey, if you wanna keep killing scan ships, I'm sure the Nine Tails will dig it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Buyer_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HopeYoureEn=Hope you're en route to my buyer to offload that merch. I just got word that they aren't gonna be buying for too much longer.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Buyer_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereFor=Ruto here for a quick sec. My buyer doesn't look like they're gonna be buying for too much longer, so if you got merch to sell, I'd hot-foot it over there.

ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_001=A claim has been processed for a ~mission(Location) belonging to one of our policy holders after the vessel was recently rendered inoperable.\n\nHowever, Olympus Principal has learned that there may still be valuable packages of zeta-prolanide onboard in a salvageable state. The successful salvage of these materials would go a long way in helping us recuperate our expenses, and as such, we are seeking a contractor to perform the retrieval operation on our behalf.\n\nAs you may know, zeta-prolanide is extremely volatile. If it is not kept in a powered stabilizer, it will grow dangerously unstable over time. We believe that salvage from ~mission(Location|Address) should still be stable for a little while longer, but be mindful as soon as they are removed you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nWhen approaching the incident site, please be on alert in case dangerous or hostile elements are still present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_002=Olympus Principal is seeking a salvage team to remove valuable packages of zeta-prolanide from a recently lost ~mission(Location). The hope is that the recovery of these materials will be able to offset any expenditures related to our client's claim of loss.\n\nAs you may know, if zeta-prolanide is not kept in a powered stabilizer it becomes extremely volatile over time. This will make any salvage attempt more complicated. \n\nOnce the containers are removed from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable. \n\nThere is a chance that word of this valuable salvage has gotten out to other interested parties and it is recommended that you proceed with caution in case there are hostiles present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_003=An inoperable vehicle claim has recently been filed by one of our clients for a ~mission(Location). The vessel was lost while transporting valuable packages of zeta-prolanide. It is our belief that those containers are still intact, and as the current property owner, Olympus Principal is eager to attempt to salvage them.\n\nWe are seeking professionals to handle this operation on our behalf owing to the dangerous nature of transporting zeta-prolanide once it is removed from a powered stabilizer. After you collect the containers from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable and lose all value to us. Please be very mindful of these time constraints.\n\nNote that other interested parties (possibly hostile) may have gotten word of the valuables onboard the wreckage, and extreme caution should be used in the area.

Ruto_Allies=Nine Tails
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_E_Desc=Here's the deal. ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) need to die at the same time. Unfortunately, they aren't gonna be in the same place.\n\nA double hit can sound complicated, but if you hire some additional guns it shouldn't be all that hard to do two hits simultaneously.\n\nMake sure you find folks who have skills as I have it on good authority that each'll be flying with some escorts for "protection." 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_E_Title=together forever
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_H_Desc=Have another pair that needs simultaneous deathing. Seems to be getting more and more popular as a murder option. \n\nThis time it's ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). Both are supposed to be pretty skilled operators and they won't be flying alone. \n\nI'd make sure whoever you get to help you on this one can handle a fight. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_H_Title=twice the headache
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Desc=Guess what ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) have in common? \n\nYou're gonna kill 'em both!\n\nDifficult part is that I need you to kill them at the same time so that one doesn't have a chance to escape, or worse, kill the person trying to kill them. \n\nSo put together a team to track one target while you handle the other. Divide and conquer!\n\nAnd despite the fact they made a mess big enough to get themselves killed, my understanding is that they are relative lightweights. Don't expect you to meet too much resistance.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Title=simultaneous release
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_M_Desc=I really hope that you're not buddies with ~mission(TargetName) or ~mission(TargetName2) because I need you to ghost the pair of them... at the same time...\n\nOf course they wouldn't make this easy on us and travel in the same ship or something obvious like that. No. You're going to have to put together a crew so that you can down both targets simultaneously. \n\nAs soon as one of them is dead, be ready to drop the other one too. Can't risk either of them getting away.\n\nAnd I figure I should mention that not only are both pretty good pilots, but that they'll be traveling with backup too. Nothing you can't handle I'm sure.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_M_Title=friends to the end
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_S_Desc=If you had asked me, I would've said ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) would have wound up eventually killing each other. But instead you're going to get the honor of killing them both at the same time.\n\nYou're going to have to work for it, though.\n\nEach one is trouble. Serious records, highly trained, and too smart to fly without backup.\n\nGather the best crew you can on this one. You'll need it. And don't be stingy. You can't spend credits if you're dead.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_S_Title=double trouble
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VE_Desc=It's pretty touching when you run across a pair that's willing to die for one another. Stupid but touching.\n\n~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) chose to stand by each other and now its gone and got them dead.\n\nFind a friend of your own and hunt each of these two down. Make sure you kill them at the same time. Call it poetic justice.\n\nThey should die pretty easy. Maybe they'll have a ship or two with them but I don't think it'll be anything to worry about. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VE_Title=death do us part
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VH_Desc=~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). I think they may be related? Or dating? Doesn't really matter, someone wants them killed. \n\nI've arranged it so that you can hit them when they're not flying together. Safer for you this way. They are both serious business and fly with equally serious backup.\n\nMake sure you and your crew time your attacks. I don't want one of them left alive or it's going to be a real headache.

Terra1_Desc=Aero is a mesoplanet with rich mineral deposits but too harsh of a climate to make them easily accessible. 
Terra1a=Petram
Terra1a_Desc=A small captured carbonaceous asteroid that orbits Aero.
Terra1b=Petrus
Terra1b_Desc=A lumpy irregularly shaped moon with an inclined orbit. 
Terra2=Pike
Terra2_Desc=The lack of an atmosphere hasn't stopped industrial magnates from descending on the vast mineral resources of this terrestrial planet. Thousands of mining operations are in near-constant operation to help fulfill resource requirements for the system.
Terra2a=Toja
Terra2a_Desc=Tidally locked, the far side of this moon features heavy scarring from frequent impacts. 
Terra3=Terra
Terra3_Desc=Upon discovery, this naturally-occurring oxygen-based planet seemed like an untouched Earth and so they named it Terra as a reflection for the birthplace of Humanity. Over the centuries, Terra has grown into one of the jewels of the Empire, becoming a political and cultural force. Home to the Transitionalist political movement who believe that Terra better represents the future of the UEE than the current capital, Earth. 
Terra3a=Eda
Terra3a_Desc=Though Eda is similar in mass to Sol 3a, its close orbit around Terra causes more extreme tides than are found on Earth.
Terra4=Gen
Terra4_Desc=Known locally as Gen, this terraformed super-Earth is situated on the further edge of the green band and is often overlooked when compared to Terra.

Since its discovery, Terra has grown consistently in both popularity and influence. Even during the Messer era, Terra was one of the few systems that tried to maintain a progressive stance against the despotic reign. It was this perseverance in the face of adversity that has elevated it to be almost synonymous with Earth as the center of power in the UEE.

assassin_danger_0001=If even half the rumors about them are true, you're going to want to take them out long before they see you coming. 
assassin_danger_0002=Apparently, this is supposed to be one of the more dangerous hitters in the sector. Do not make the mistake of underestimating them. 
assassin_danger_0003=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Something tells me you might need it to take them down. 
assassin_danger_0004=Word of warning, no way someone like ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going down easy. You want to take them out? Do it hard and fast. 
assassin_danger_0005=While you should be careful, cause you never know - my guess is that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is gonna drop easy. Poor sod chooses to fly solo and hardly ever bothers with anything more than a few escorts. 
assassin_danger_0006=As for gearing up for this little job, you shouldn't need anything out of the ordinary. ~mission(TargetName|Last) prefers to fly alone. I mean, for a real special occasion they might travel with a friend or two, but I'd be surprised.  
assassin_danger_0007=Apparently, there's a good chance this scav's not gonna be traveling alone either. Seems that their little multicrew ship hardly ever flies without at least one or two friends along for the trip.  
assassin_danger_0008=Word is that the small multicrew ship ~mission(TargetName|Last) captains is being guarded by a few hired escorts. Can't say for sure if it's true, but good to be careful just in case.  
assassin_danger_0009=Rumor has it that ~mission(TargetName|Last) typically travels with a full escort so be ready to hit hard. Even if you do get lucky and catch them alone, you'll still have their ship to deal with and supposedly they captain a bit of a beast. 
assassin_danger_0010=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Since ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually captains a bigger multicrew ship and springs the extra credits for escort, something tells me you might need the extra firepower.

assassin_desc_0001=Looking for someone who doesn't mind getting their hands dirty. Not talking guild work or anything, just someone who's good enough to aim and squeeze.

assassin_desc_0002=Got a mess that needs cleaning up. Paying solid credits for it too. The mess goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nBuddy of mine saw them around ~mission(Location), but the rest is up to you. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0003=There's a price on ~mission(TargetName)'s head. ~mission(MultiPlayer)Credits go to whoever bags the bastard first. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I'd recommend starting at ~mission(Location) but hey, don't let me tell you how to do your job. ~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0004=Guess who just got themselves placed onto the 'no-breathe-list'? Some dragger named ~mission(TargetName). Yeah, I never heard of them either, but better them than us, right? \n\n~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)Word is they've been haunting ~mission(Location) lately, so you'll probably want to start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)Good luck.
assassin_desc_0005=I don't know what ~mission(TargetName) did, but they sure pissed off the wrong people. Credits go to whoever can give them a last lesson in manners straight through the head. ~mission(Danger) \n\nThere isn't much to go on, just some scattered sightings around ~mission(Location), so maybe start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)~mission(MultiPlayer)One last thing, the client wants you to say '~mission(Phrase).' when the trigger's pulled. Don't ask. Just do it. 
assassin_desc_0006=~mission(TargetName) is breathing borrowed air. Time's come to punch their ticket for good. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I can give you ~mission(Location) but you have to provide your own transport and clean weapons. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0007=You know how they say the good die young? It's definitely true in this case. A hit's been put out on ~mission(TargetName), a local security thug that's hellbent on being a hero. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0008=Why don't these security assholes ever learn to mind their own damn business? It's like they want to get murdered. Especially this one. Name's ~mission(TargetName). Been stirring up huge trouble lately, but you're gonna put a permanent end to that.\n\n~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Knowing these security types, don't be surprised if they call for back up.
assassin_desc_0009=About time someone put ~mission(TargetName) in their place. This security hackjob's been taking bribes to look the other way, but the greedy little idiot decided to raise the rates. Big mistake! \n\nNow instead of those credits going to pay the smug bastard off, they're being used to pay you to murder their ass. That's some poetic justice right there. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0010=This bounty hunter by the name of ~mission(TargetName) made the mistake of messing with the wrong crew. They're looking to even the score and are offering pretty decent creds to whoever does the deed. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0011=I love it. This is one of those classic 'the hunter has become the hunted' scenarios you always see on the spec. \n\nA big bounty's been placed on the head of bounty hunter ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) It'll be interesting to see how they like it when they tables are turned. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_easy=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationEasyDescription)
assassin_desc_first=Listen, I know you don't know me, but that's kinda the point of this little experiment. We're just two complete strangers helping each other out. \n\nHere's how this works - I give you a name. ~mission(TargetName), for example. Then I'll tell you a place: ~mission(Location). Now, if by some complete and utter coincidence, they wind up shot to death a little while later, a bunch of credits will mystically appear in your account. Long story short, ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) has some bad luck, you have some good luck. Everybody's happy.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other people eager for the help of a dependable stranger and if you do a good job here, I'll make sure they know you're the stranger to talk to.\n\nGood luck out there.

I need you to get down there and destroy the drugs they’re storing on site.\n\nThere's a good chance the facility isn't abandoned, so you might run into these thugs when you head down there, so be ready for a fight.

I need you to get down there and destroy the drugs they’re storing on site.\n\nThey won’t be happy about it, so you’ll probably have a fight on your hands, but the important thing is clearing out the product.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

blacjac_bounty_desc_HRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nYour next bounty, ~mission(TargetName), is definitely considered a high-risk target for good reason. They’re known to travel with some serious firepower and are escorted by enough protection to make anyone think twice about picking a fight.\n\nSources indicate that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is hiding out over at ~mission(Location|Address). When you head out to track them down, just make sure you’re prepared.

blacjac_bounty_desc_LRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nBounty came in for a low-risk target by the name of ~mission(TargetName). The target themselves isn’t all that much to worry about, but it seems that they typically fly in a pack, so there’s a high chance they’ll have a few friends along when you track them down.\n\nSpeaking of, I’d start the hunt over at ~mission(Location|Address) since we have reports of them being spotted in the area.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_MRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNeed you to sort out ~mission(TargetName), a moderate-risk bounty last seen at ~mission(Location|Address) flying a small, multicrew ship. \n\nWe weren’t able to get details on exactly what they were piloting, but it seems they did have a few other ships with them.

blacjac_bounty_desc_VLRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a very low-risk target I need you to take care of: ~mission(TargetName).\n\nTheir last known location was ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nThis is a low threat bounty, so I expect you to be able to clear it pretty fast. They typically fly a small ship and don’t have very many known acquaintances.

We got more jobs than our current contractors can handle, so I’m hoping that you might be able to help pick up some of the slack.  \n\nYour qualifications look good on paper, but before we make anything official, BlacJac needs to see how you perform in the field firsthand. Even got a test case all lined up – we want you to sort out ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). Should be a fairly straightforward bounty without too much resistance. Perfect thing to sharpen your teeth on.\n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_rehire=ATTN: Former BlacJac Bounty Hunter\n\nI know your last sting bounty hunting for BlacJac didn’t go well, but a soaring caseload means that you are lucky enough to get another chance.\n\nIf you're able to complete the bounty on ~mission(TargetName) over at ~mission(Location|Address) then we can see about getting you reinstated.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_fps_UGF_bountyonly_desc_001=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a bounty for you. Goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName).

Do whatever you have to do with the bounty, but I don’t want any other casualties. \n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_bounty_fps_UGF_desc_001=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a bounty that needs to be collected on ~mission(TargetName).

blacjac_bounty_fps_UGF_nocivs_desc_001=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNeed you to grab a bounty by the name of ~mission(TargetName) at ~mission(Location|Address).

blacjac_danger_002=Knowing this area and the kind of people we're dealing with, my gut says head in expecting a fight. 
blacjac_danger_003=You'll be kicking a bit of a hornet's nest on this one, so be ready for heavy resistance. 
blacjac_danger_004=This perp is a bit of lightweight. Only a few known associates and they typically fly solo crafts. Shouldn't be to hard to catch them. 
blacjac_danger_005=The files on ~mission(TargetName|Last) show that they typically captain a mid-sized multicrew vessel and have been known to employ extra muscle on jobs. Might want to approach with a bit of caution. 
blacjac_danger_006=Be sure that you're ready to face heavy resistance. ~mission(TargetName|Last) is known to captain larger ships and with their connections you can almost guarantee that they're not traveling alone. 
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nWe have a problem over at ~mission(Location|Address). Apparently someone set up PDC Monitors to illegally skim data. \n\nYou are being tasked with locating the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroying them. \n\nThere are a few possible complications:\n- These things are designed to operate passively with as low of an EM sig as possible. Finding them might take some effort and thorough scanning. \n- Monitors like these often have automatic security protocols so that if they are attacked, they begin to transmit any stored dated. It's vital you destroy them before the upload can finish.\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nI'm hopeful you'll be able to resolve the issue before any more data is stolen.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0002=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nReceived a report that some enterprising criminal has been skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address) using PDC Monitors. \n\nYou are being tasked to locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroy them. I suspect it might take a bit of scanning to locate the monitors as they're designed to operate passively. Plus, as soon as you start attacking, their security countermeasures are going to kick in and attempt to upload their data-drives. You'll need to be fast enough to prevent the transfer. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks for taking care of this,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0003=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nI need a merc who can handle locating and destroying PDC monitors that have been illegally skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address). This will take some doing as the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) will be operating passively and difficult to find without performing a thorough scan of the area. Plus, you'll have to destroy the monitors before their emergency defense system uploads any more of the data they've stolen.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

Basically, feel free to engage with any lowlifes you come across, but that's not what you're getting paid for - BlacJac's focus for this op is the drugs. \n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

Basically, do what you can to keep most of the surrounding area intact. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nYou'll be paid based on how much of the drug stash you personally clear out. Getting this product off the streets is a huge win for BlacJac, and of course the people of ArcCorp.\n\nGood hunting,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroystash_desc_003=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nThe location of long suspected narcotics stash known as ~mission(Location|Address) has finally been confirmed and we need to raid the site before they have a chance to migrate again. \n\nDestroy any and all drugs found at the site using whatever means you have. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nAnd remember, you'll be reimbursed based on how much of the narcotics you personally eliminate, not how many drug dealers you wipe out. Leadership's focus right now is the drugs, not the pushers because bodies are cheap.

ccdemo19_desc=Helluva job on that last gig. So good that when I was talking to a client of mine who works for some corp and was looking for a solid team. I instantly thought of you.\n\nTheir company heard that microTech is developing a cutting edge compression algorithm that could potentially put them out of business, so needless to say, they're very motivated in getting their hands on it and they're willing to pay handsomely. \n\nThe problem is that the program is being developed in one of microTech's off-site research facilities. Traffic into the base is heavily regulated, so you will need to steal an ID to make them think you are one of the workers. Security will be heavy, but I trust you will have ways to evade them.\n\nOnce you steal the code, I will provide you with a location for the drop away from prying eyes.

civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_001=Happy Luminalia!\n\nI have a huge favor to ask. Thanks to some very ill timed maintenance issues, my ship is out of commission for at least a week and I won't be able to finish delivering presents to everyone on my gift list.\n\nLooked into using FTL but with their holiday pricing I'll end up paying more credits than what the gifts cost! \n\nFigured I would see if you're interested in helping me out. I get my gifts delivered on time and you get some extra Luminalia spending credits. \n\nThe three gifts are wrapped and waiting at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address). One is for ~mission(GiftRecipient1|First) over at ~mission(DropOff1), another's for ~mission(GiftRecipient2|First) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last one is for ~mission(GiftRecipient3|First) who's at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nThanks in advance and may your light glow a little brighter this year!\n\nSincerely,\n~mission(GiftSender|First)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_002=I'm in desperate need of a little Luminalia magic and I hope you're the one to help.\n\nThere are three gifts stuck at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address) that need to be delivered. \n\nI tried scheduling a pick up but just got notified that they won't be able to make it until after the holidays. Would you be able to take care of the deliveries for me? I'll gladly pay you what I was going to give them.\n\nIt shouldn't be too hard. One is for ~mission(GiftRecipient1) over at ~mission(DropOff1), another's for ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last one is for ~mission(GiftRecipient3) who's at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nWhatever you decide to help or not, I hope you have a very happy holiday!\n\n- ~mission(GiftSender)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_003=Hope the holiday season is treating you well.\n\nMine's been a bit stressful so far. It turns out that I put the wrong delivery address on a handful of gifts and I'm desperately seeking a way to get them delivered on time. \n\nIt would mean so much to me if you could get me out of this jam. \n\nThe presents are at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address) and will need to be delivered to: \n- ~mission(GiftRecipient1) at ~mission(DropOff1)\n- ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2)\n- ~mission(GiftRecipient3) at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nThank you and best holiday wishes,\n~mission(GiftSender)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_004=I know things get busy around the holidays, but I was reaching out to see if you had any extra time to do a delivery run.\n\nGot a few presents at ~mission(Pickup1|Address)  for close friends that I won't be able to deliver myself. \nYou would need to take one to ~mission(GiftRecipient1) at ~mission(DropOff1), another to ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last to ~mission(GiftRecipient3) at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nMuch appreciated,\n~mission(GiftSender)

commarray_hack_danger_0003=I'm not expecting trouble, but knowing what security is like in that sector, it's not out of the question. 
commarray_hack_danger_0004=If I'm being honest, these ~mission(Client) had one of their own try to handle the array, and they got taken out. Just don't let the same thing happen to you. Go in prepared, you should come out fine. 
commarray_hack_desc=~mission(Description)
commarray_hack_desc_0001=A couple of ~mission(Client) are working on a big score and they need ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) shut down to make sure they get some privacy. Once it's offline, we'll need you to hang out there to make sure the commlink stays down long enough. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd DON'T forget, you'll need a CRYPTOKEY to access the array's controls. \nBring your own if you want, but you can head to ~mission(Location|Address) and grab one there.\nHate for you to head all the way out to the array and not be able to do the damn job.
commarray_hack_desc_0002=~mission(MissionLocation|Address) being online's going to be a problem for some ~mission(Client) working the area. \nShut it down, keep it offline 'til the job's complete, and we'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nOf course, you won't be able to access the array's controls unless you have a CRYPTOKEY with you. \nWe arranged for one to be waiting for you at ~mission(Location|Address) if you don't already have one. 
commarray_hack_desc_0003=I don't want to get too specific, but let's just say it would be better for everyone if someone could make sure that ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) was taken out of commission and that it stayed that way for a while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd I shouldn't have to mention this, but for the love of everything, bring a CRYPTOKEY with you. Last thing we need is you showing up unprepared. \nActually, you know what, if you don't already have one, there's a cryptokey at ~mission(Location|Address) that you can use.
commarray_hack_desc_0004=Certain ~mission(Client) have a job in the works, but they can't do it as long as the ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) is still online. Need a systems-grok to disable the comm uplink, and stay onsite long enough to make sure there aren't any issues. ~mission(Danger) Credits on completion. No up-front. \n\n---> REMINDER: Bring a CRYPTOKEY with you to hack the array's controls. Either grab one from ~mission(Location|Address) or bring your own.
commarray_hack_desc_0005=Here's the breakdown -  ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) needs to be taken offline, and ~mission(Client) are looking to hire a hacker to do it and guarantee the uplink's down for as long as needed. ~mission(Danger)That's about all you need to know.\n\n*** P.S. You'll need a CRYPTOKEY to access the control panel. We arranged one to be waiting for you at ~mission(Location|Address), but if you prefer to use your own, that's fine too.

commarray_repair_danger_0003=Take precautions when you head over to the site. With the array down we can't be sure what or who might be lurking out there. 
commarray_repair_danger_0004=Shouldn't have to say this, but use some common sense when you're out there and be ready just in case you run in to some trouble. 
commarray_repair_danger_0005=One thing to keep in mind is that you should probably make sure your security measures are up to snuff before going.

confirmkill_desc_0002=I keep telling people you gotta vet before you hire, but do they listen? Course not. Take the ~mission(Client) for example. They paid some alleyscag to off ~mission(TargetName), but now they're worried the job might not actually be done and they want someone to go out to ~mission(Location) and verify the hit. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Interested?
confirmkill_desc_0003=Another job of mine was supposed to be all wrapped up, but now the ~mission(Client) are worried that ~mission(TargetName) might still be upright.

confirmkill_desc_0004=Not sure if you heard yet, apparently ~mission(TargetName) is dead. Like dead, dead.

confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) paid big credits to have this problem of theirs permanently solved, but I guess the proof of death didn't come through. Sucks for them, but works out for me and you. I can't go myself, but I can give you the location of ~mission(Location). Go and confirm that ~mission(TargetName) is toe up. ~mission(Danger)Simple enough job, don't even have to kill anyone yourself, and the credits are right. ~mission(Timed)
confirmkill_desc_0006=Hope you don't mind corpses, cause I need you to get up close and personal with one. Used to go by the name ~mission(TargetName). You should find what's left of them at ~mission(Location) and hopefully confirm that the bastard's really dead. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Anything else you find when you're out there is fair game.
confirmkill_desc_0007=Got word that ~mission(TargetName) might be dead. 'Might' ain't gonna cut it with me, so I want you to go to ~mission(Location) and make sure of it.~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)If you have any other questions, just figure it out yourself. That's what I pay you for.

covalexrand_desc_0001=Been waiting forever for Covalex to get their act together after the accident they had, but I just don't think it's going to happen at this point. Hoping you could go out to Gundo and grab my order for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)I don't need you to take it all the way to me either. I arranged for shipment from ~mission(Destination) so all you'd have to do is leave it there at the front desk for me.\n\nThanks,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0002=I had an important shipment with Covalex and apparently it was waiting at Gundo when they had that big accident there. They said the delivery was going to be delayed, but it's been months now and they're still telling me the same exact thing. No new information or anything. I'm losing a ton of money on this and the best they can offer me is an apology. Not good enough. Figure if they can't finish the delivery, I'll find someone who can. ~mission(Reference)Need it delivered to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0003=Hey, a gift I ordered is stuck out on that Covalex station that exploded or whatever and now they say they can't deliver it. I'm really sorry about what happened there, but I already missed our anniversary and if I miss their birthday too, I'm gonna be dead. Basically, I need that box to be at ~mission(Destination) by any means necessary. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed) 
covalexrand_desc_0004=Look, we can all agree it was a real tragedy what happened out there at Gundo, and I'm sorry people lost their lives, but that doesn't mean I don't need my package delivered, right? And if Covalex isn't willing or able to do it, then I have every right to go and get delivered on my own. That only seems fair. ~mission(Reference)If you're interested, I'll need it taken to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)\n\nGood luck,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0005=I'm in a bit of a bind. A delivery I've been expecting was rerouted through Covalex's Gundo station out near Crusader, but an accident there stopped all shipments. I tried getting a refund, but the company I ordered from says it's Covalex's fault, and Covalex says that their terms of service covers a delay like this. ~mission(Timed)I guess at this point I just want my package and I don't really care how I get it. Even to the point where I'm willing to pay the extra shipping to have someone just take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)
covalexrand_desc_0006=I need someone with access to a ship to fly out to Covalex's Gundo station and take a box there to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Reference)And before you get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not talking about stealing or anything, because it's my package. Covelex is just dragging their feet delivering it because of the investigation or safety or whatever excuse they're using. ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0007=A package I ordered is stuck because of the accident that happened at Gundo. I paid good creds for this and now it's just sitting there gathering dust. Seems to me that if Covalex isn't gonna do anything about it, then I might as well pay someone to find it and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0008=I am going crazy. Covalex keeps telling me that they delivered my package, but I didn't get it. The last routing information I have places it at their Gundo center, so I'm thinking that it got misplaced when they had the big accident there. ~mission(Reference)If you could go check it out, I bet you anything that it's just sitting there. ~mission(Timed)If it is there, I'll pay to have you bring it to ~mission(Destination).

covalexrand_reference_0004=I heard about the investigation work you did at the station, and figured since you know the lay of the land already you'd be the perfect person to hit up. 
covalexrand_reference_0005=You've been to Gundo before, right? Makes sense that going back shouldn't be that big of an issue for you.

covalexspec_description_0001=Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at ~mission(Destination), I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya
covalexspec_description_0002=My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed
covalexspec_description_0003=Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to ~mission(Destination) for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace
covalexspec_description_0004=My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to ~mission(Destination), so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone
covalexspec_description_0005=They said that I could find someone here to go to Gundo for me and grab a crate that belonged to my wife. If the name didn't ring a bell, that's the station where they had that big accident. My wife worked for Covalex and I know it's not really going to make losing her any easier, but I really just want Claudia's stuff back. I think about her photo collection or the necklace I gave her just sitting there in that cold dead station in some box marked 249 and it's not right. She deserves better. So how about it? You willing to go to Gundo and haul her crate back to ~mission(Destination)?
covalexspec_description_0006=Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to head to the Covalex Gundo station near Crusader and grab some items. I know this may sound like stealing, but it's my dad's stuff. You see, he was on Gundo station when it had its accident. My mom says that we need to wait until Covalex says so, but I don't think that's fair because I miss him so much. I would like something to remember him by and I don't want to wait any longer because I might start forgetting things. I'll pay you to get box 510 for me and take to ~mission(Destination) so I can have it.\n\nThank you very much,\nBaylor Ward

There's a few extra creds coming your way if you do.
criminal_recoverstash_desc_04=Thank the stars that dumb outlaws will always talk too much when they're hopped up on rot. This one git I was drinking with blabbed about a score they had secreted away in a hidden spot.\n\nFigured we could teach them a lesson about the importance of holding your liquor.\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find their stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nThere's a chance this bumbling idiot and their friends might be hold up there too, so be careful.

criminal_recoverstash_desc_05=Not a lot of people know this but, a few days ago my stash got raided by some clueless fetchlicks who decided robbing me was a smart thing to do.\n\nWell, it turns out it wasn't cause I was able to track the numcells down to where they're hiding.

criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_01=It pays to keep an ear open, and in this case, it pays very well.\n\nDiscovered where a nice little treasure is being secreted away, and with your help, we can take it for ourselves.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation) and  find all of the stash hidden there. You may have to hunt around a bit since its probably wont just be sitting out in the open.\n\nOnce you have it all, bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address) and I'll pay you your cut.\n\nIt's not clear yet if the site is being guarded or not, but we'll know for sure one way or the other once you're there. If there is resistance, you'll be compensated for taking the extra risk.
criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_02=You in the mood for a bit of a treasure hunt? \n\nOne of my crew was snatched recently and overhead some other scavs talking about how they had hidden away some pretty choice loot before being locked up. \n\nYou're going to steal it for me.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation). That's where they stashed the loot. \n\nOnce there, you're on your own to search the area and find where everything is hidden.\n\nAfter you found all of the stash, haul it over to ~mission(Destination|Address). Payment on delivery.\n\nLast thing. Not all of their gang was caught so there still might be a few hanging around. Don't worry though. If they're there, I'll throw some extra creds your way to make it up to you.
criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_03=Not sure if you've been hearing the rumors, but I think I figured out where that gang that pulled that big score last week hid everything they stole.\n\nIt's just sitting out there while they wait for the heat to die down. Real shame if anything happened to it...\n\nFor example if someone were to go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation), search around, find where all the stolen loot is, and bring all of it to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nBet a person who did something like that would stand to make a lot of credits.\n\nOf course the biggest risk would be if there were guards in the area, but if that were the case, I'm sure a bonus payment would make it worth the trouble.

crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0004=I shouldn't be surprised, but it seems like these criminals keep showing more ingenuity every day.

Make sure that you scan the area carefully to find them. On the bright side though, once you attack one, they'll light up into emergency data transfer mode.

They're a real pain in the ass to find, but having to scan the area for them's only half the problem. \n\nOnce you take a shot, boom, they're programmed to shut down and upload their data back to central.

Let's just say that I'm not the only one who shares this sentiment. ~mission(Contractor|Name) are even paying to restore the balance. \n\nThese PDC Monitors are a pain to find so you'll need to scan the area. Plus, when you engage, you'll need to destroy them before they finish uploading all the dirt they've scraped up. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0006=Security thinks they're so smart. They set up ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) near ~mission(Location) to gather intel on the ~mission(Contractor|Name).

All you got to do is be the one to actually scan the area to find where the PDC Monitors are hiding and take 'em out. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)Another thing to keep in mind, these things are wired to protect the info they're pulling, so once you shoot, you gotta destroy them all before they can upload all their data.

destroyprobelegal_desc_0001=We've received intel from ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) that local criminal elements are operating ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to eavesdrop on security forces. As such, authorization has been given to enlist private contractors to help eliminate these devices.  You'll need to carefully scan the area once you arrive to identify the exact location of the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount). Since they passively skim information, they can be tricky to find.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nWord of warning, outlaws tend to rig these PDC Monitors with defensive protocols to automatically back up the data when attacked, so once you start shooting, you'll need to destroy them all quickly before the transfer can finish.
destroyprobelegal_desc_0002=Independent combat operators are needed to eliminate unauthorized surveillance monitors placed around ~mission(Location|Address). According to the initial report, ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has identified ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) intercepting data. Scanning the area for their location might be difficult since they have such low EM signatures, but they must be found and destroyed before sensitive intel is leaked. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These 'skimmers' are outfitted with data security protocols. They will begin transferring the data they've gathered when threatened, so operators will need to destroy them before the upload is allowed to complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0003=We've received reports that criminal elements have installed ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to spy on the area. Thankfully, we've finally been given the green light to hire combat operators to attack and destroy these systems. That's where you come in. \n\nYou will need to scan the area to find the PDC Monitors' location before the data illicitly gathered can be uploaded. The 'skimmers' will be in their passive data collection mode when you arrive making the search for them difficult, but know that once attacked, they will begin transmitting the contents of their drives. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0004=We are looking for experienced combat pilots to assist in the destruction of illegal surveillance systems that have been appearing in the sector. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw 'skimmers' have contributed to the deaths of security personnel as well as civilians by providing local criminals with intel about security movements and deployments. \n\nYou will be tasked with scanning the area around ~mission(Location|Address) where ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has indicated that you'll find ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) in operation. They will be well hidden thanks to their minimal power output. However, once engaged, these monitors will cease being covert and begin to upload their contents. You must destroy them before they complete the transfer otherwise highly sensitive data may be lost. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0005=Outlaw groups have been using ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on security forces by skimming data transmitted to and from ~mission(Location|Address). We are now actively seeking combat pilots to find and destroy these unauthorized 'skimmers.' ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)Know that it'll be difficult to hunt for their exact location since the monitors are design to only emit the barest of signatures and you may need to perform a thorough scan of the area. \n\nYou are to travel to the area, locate and then destroy all outlaw devices before any more innocent lives are lost. These PDC Monitors are outfitted with a failsafe program that will upload all data when attacked, so you will need to act before this process can complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0006=Combat pilots wanted to track and destroy unauthorized surveillance monitors. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw PDC monitors are a threat to public safety and must be eliminated. You will find ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) near ~mission(Location|Address), but the exact placement remains unknown at this time. Only a careful on-site scan will be able to reveal exactly where these monitors are gathering intel. \n\nOur Security Officers have noted that the devices will start uploading their contents when attacked. We cannot let this data fall into criminal hands, so make sure you destroy them quickly. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)

dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking=Dumb-fire missiles need no lock and fire instantly but have no tracking capability.\nHeat-seeking missiles require the target to remain in front of the ship for an amount of time dictated by several factors including your distance from the target and their infra-red emissions. Cross-section missiles (like the type your ship is armed with) focuses its tracking on the ships size and geometry. So the further away you are from the enemy, the harder it is for the missile to track.
dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking_Title=Missile Locking (2/2)

dfm_ui_Control_Frame=The control frame reticle (CFR) shows the goal attitude that your ship is trying to attain. When torque/thruster error or other outside forces prevent the ship from attaining the goal the control frame reticle will deviate from the nose reticle. In these circumstances you should rely on the control frame reticle to pilot the ship as the forward velocity vector will always be in that direction. IFCS will then drive the nose reticle toward the CFR as it corrects the error.

dfm_ui_CoreDefender=Core Defender
dfm_ui_Countermeasures=When a missile is locked on your ship or an enemy is trying to achieve missile lock, you can attempt to break lock by using a countermeasure.\nTo fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Cont=\nCountermeasures are designed to disrupt specific types of missiles lock.\n~icon(Flare|22|22) The Decoy produces an intense burst of heat in an attempt to lure any pursuing heat-seeking missiles away from your ship. Decoys burn out quickly so missiles may reacquire lock-on if you fire on too early.\n~icon(Chaff|22|22) The Noise explodes into an expanding cloud of tiny filaments designed to confuse radar systems and break the lock of missiles with an electromagnetic lock-on system.\nYou can cycle the type of countermeasure armed by pressing [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_cycle_countermeasure_fwd)].

dfm_ui_FlightMode_Cruise_Mode=The mode above SCM is Cruise.\nThis is a high velocity mode that sacrifices control for speed. Use it to travel more quickly through the local area. It can take some time to reach maximum cruise velocity and even longer to stop with your retro thrusters so be sure to plan your decelerations accordingly.\nCruise is disabled during Basic Training.
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Cruise_Mode_Title=Flight Modes (3/4)
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Precision=The mode above Precision is Space Combat Maneuvering (SCM).\nThis is the typical mode used in combat and non-combat flight. Most of your flight time will be spent in this mode. Select this mode any time you wish to have the optimal balance of velocity and drift control.

dfm_ui_FreeLook_Mouse_Reminder=Freelook can be toggled by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)]. While Freelook is enabled you will not be able to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Other=To look around your cockpit, push [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_aim_yaw)] in the direction you want to look. After a short time without input, your view will be reset to the center.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Pad=When using the Game Pad's right stick your view will be locked as the right stick primarily controls the steering of your ship. You can toggle Freelook by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)] to allow the right stick to look around your cockpit.\nBe aware, whilst Freelook is active you will be unable to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Pad_Reminder=Freelook can be toggled by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)]. While Freelook is enabled you will not be able to steer your ship.

dfm_ui_ITTS=With a target focused, your ship's targeting system will try to predict where you need to fire to hit the target with each of your weapons.\nIt does so by extending PIPs (Predicted Impact Point) from your Line of Sight reticule. Each PIP corresponds to a weapon and indicates where its projectiles will intercept given the distance and velocity of the target.\nPIPs are only predicted so if your target is far away it may alter its velocity and avoid the projectile. As a general rule, ballistic projectiles will take longer to reach a target than an energy projectile, therefore their PIPs will be projected further ahead.

Once engaged, any available landing zones within radar range will display as radar contacts with the nearest automatically becoming focused.\nBe aware that engaging the Landing System disables your combat targeting systems meaning you will lose the ability to lock and fire missiles.
dfm_ui_LandingModes=With the Landing System enabled there are two modes in which you can land.\nYou will begin in Manual Mode. To automate the landing procedure, engage the Automated Mode with [~action(spaceship_movement|v_cycle_landing_mode)] and fly over the landing zone. This will catch you and set you down safely, though not as quickly as if you were to master a manual landing.

distraction_desc_0001=Put down whatever you're doing and pay attention. This is a big one.\n\nThe ~mission(Client) got a massive score cooking, but in order to pull it off, they need an equally massive distraction. \n\nThat's you.\n \nYou're gonna head over to a ~mission(Location) and start nuking everything and everyone you can. ~mission(Wanted)You'll be making so much noise, no one will even care what the ~mission(Client) are up to.
distraction_desc_0002=You ever dream about flying out to some remote ~mission(Location) and shooting everything that moves? Well, guess what? I'm here to make your dreams come true. And not only that, I'm gonna pay you for it.\n\nI can't tell you all the specifics, but the upshot is that the ~mission(Client) are eager to make sure all the security in sector are kept as busy as possible.\n\nNow, it seemed to me that sending someone to rampage at the ~mission(Location) would be a damn good start. ~mission(Wanted)Shouldn't be too hard to keep everyone's attention after that.
distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(Client) are looking to pay good credits for someone to create a distraction for them. And since I can't figure out how to lure a Vanduul fleet to the sector, a cutthroat like you flying to a ~mission(Location) and unleashing hell might be the next best thing. ~mission(Wanted)\n\nCan you believe some people choose to work in an office for a living?
distraction_desc_0004=Hey. Did you ever hear about the system-wide hunt in Ellis for that slicer a little while back? Advocacy were running in circles for days trying to take them down. Got me thinking. The ~mission(Client) are going after a huge score soon and then I thought, why not just arrange for something similar to happen here? Get all the security in the area chasing after a target so that they're blind to whatever else is going on. It would make the ~mission(Client) job a billion times easier. \n\nHere's how it'll work. You fly to a ~mission(Location) and unleash some major chaos and destruction. They already patrol places like that pretty heavily so you should have company in no time flat. ~mission(Wanted)To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if that thing in Ellis wasn't just a distraction, too.

distraction_wanted_0002=There's a caveat to this whole thing, though. With the amount of attention I want on you, your crimestat needs to stay at a level 5 minimum. It's the only way to guarantee that all eyes are on you. 
distraction_wanted_0003=Of course, an ordinary two-bit criminal won't be enough to get the whole sector engaged. No, you gonna need to rock a level 5 crimestat to create the chaos I'm after. 
distraction_wanted_0004=But the way I figure it, just showing up won't be enough. We need you to maintain a level 5 crimestat the whole time. That way we make sure every do-gooder in the sector will be racing to take you down.

distractionkill_desc_0001=I heard that you're big time now with your level 5. Normally, I'd be telling you to keep your head down and till the heat blows over, but it just so happens that I got a better use for you.\n\nI've been working on something big that's ready to go down, but in order to make it happen I need someone to create a distraction that's even bigger. That's where you come in. \n\nThe way I figure it, if you take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy humps, just about every screw in the entire Empire will be focused on dragging your ass down. \n\nCan't be lower sec either. Needs to be Navy to really pull this off. That's fine though, any security gets wind of a level 5 and they'll comm the Navy to come deal with you.\n\nAnd you have to do it fast enough so that the timing works out. As soon as you open fire on the first one, the clock starts.\n\nThink you can handle that?
distractionkill_desc_0002=I'll be honest with you, I usually don't like to deal with your kind of crazy, but a mad dog is exactly what I need right now. \n\nMy crew and I need all the security in the system kept busy for a while and the only way I see that happening is if you bring down enough Navy that they don't have a choice but to stop everything and focus on you. I think about ~mission(KillCount) starmen should do it. \n\nLucky thing is, with your level 5, they should be chasing you anyway. Security stops to scan you and the Navy's gonna come straight to you. Just make sure that once you start shooting that you finish the job. As soon as you engage with the first one, the clock starts and if you don't raise the stakes high enough, me and my crew are gonna be left hanging.\n\nOf course, feel free to kill even more of the bastards if the mood takes you.
distractionkill_desc_0003=Word on the wire is that every flattop with a badge is out there scanning the system for your level 5 wanted ass. What do you say to making some credits off all that hassle?\n\nI can't tell you exactly what's going down, but it's enough for you to know that I need a cataclysmic level distraction. The kind that can only be created by a dangerous and deranged criminal going on a shooting spree and taking out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen. \n\nOnce you start shooting, my crew will move into place, so you'll have to finish the job quick. And Navy only. Popping off some Advos or local security won't cut it. Fortunately, with your crimestat anytime you run into security, Navy shouldn't be far behind.\n\nGet this done for me, and I'll see that you get your fair cut.

dusters_claimsweep_desc_002=One of ours was picking up some supplies when they overheard a miner placing a big order for the new dig they had set up over at ~mission(Location) near ~mission(LagrangeLocation).

With the haul we’re looking at, figure it’s worth spending some extra credits to hire someone good like you to take care of it.\n\nOnce you’ve sent them packing, we can come in and collect.

ea_ui_mapdesc_BrokenMoon=Formerly part of Kellar's Run, Taranis system is one of the more notorious and dangerous places in the known systems. The vast fields of asteroids offer plenty of hiding places for assassins and bushwhackers.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Crossroads=Discovered in 2445, the United Nations of Earth was conflicted about what to do with the Nexus system. Since the only jump point at the time was through Cathcart, they tried to use the system as a dedicated military training system, but budget issues forced the government to sell exclusive access to the system to the Hathor Group in a deal that ultimately inspired the sale of Stanton System centuries later. Hathor indiscriminately stripped the system of its resources then abandoned it. Over the decades, outlaws, squatters, and refugees began to move in as the system slipped into obscurity. It wasn’t until 2931 when Dean Kellar’s infamous run that the UEE realized how dangerous and entrenched these criminals had become and decided to take it back.\n\nThe year is now 2934. The UEE is still attempting to restore order by sweeping out the outlaws and squatters who have taken residence in the system. Play as a member of the UEE Advocacy tactical team, led by SAC Darrell Lincoln, or an outlaw in the Supreme gang, led by Leoni “Zombie” Kulkov, in the battle for the Hathor Mining Facility on Nexus III.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Demien=Originally built by the Hathor Group for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II, OP Station Demien has earned a much darker reputation as the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DemienComms=Originally built by the Hathor Group for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II, OP Station Demien has earned a much darker reputation as the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935. The Comms Center was a main hub of the station.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DogfightTest=Special map for Dogfight Testing
ea_ui_mapdesc_DyingStar=Pyro system didn't get its name by accident. The central star is in the middle of the prolonged nova phase, burning out the planets in the system. While dangerous, it's a morbid kind of beauty.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Echo11=A former extraction facility, Echo Eleven was abandoned when the Hathor Group left the Nexus system and has since become a vile den of squatters and outlaws.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Ministry=[PH] PLACEHOLDER DESCRIPTION
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_DeffordLink=A dangerous course that has claimed many aspiring pilots' ships. This crucible isn't always in the Murray Cup's rotation of tracks. Many feel that it's too difficult and unnecessarily risks pilots for better spec broadcasting.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_OldVanderval=One of the oldest active courses in racing. It's no longer considered an eligible race track, so any race here is considered Clean (a term which can encapsulate any amateur, non-pro or underground race). Most pilots have cut their teeth on Old Van so it's one of the more beloved tracks in the Empire.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_Rikkord=A standard fixture in Murray Cup qualifiers, Rikkord Memorial has always been a great separator between the amateurs and the professionals.
ea_ui_mapdesc_TheGoodDoctor=Hatfield & Harding had big plans for planet of Mya in the Leir System when they purchased it from Galor Messer IX in 2743. They entrusted the supervision of the terraforming and settlement to Dr. Marcus Fayel from the University of Persei’s Analytical Research and Quantification campus. Little did they know that Dr. Fayel would not only betray his employees, but he would steal the planet out from under them. On May 3, 2812, all communication with the planet was cut off. Hours later, a single message from Dr. Fayel directed to Hatfield & Harding and the rest of the universe announcing the birth of the Sun’s Eye Fellowship, a new religion based on radical isolationism, and their intent to claim Mya as their own.\n\nFayel’s former employers were furious. Against the wishes of the UEE, they assembled a covert team of mercenaries to secure the planet and eliminate Fayel as well as any followers who got in their way. The operation was a brutal massacre. The Fellowship proved to be more than willing to kill and die for their new leader. The mission’s failure led to the eventual dissolution of Hatfield & Harding and complete control of Mya to Fayel and the Fellowship who became known as the Outsiders.

fine_terminal_informationScreen_Info=\nHow are fines attributed to me?\nMost fines are issued directly by members of law enforcement, but some result from violations detected by ships and mobiGlas and automatically broadcast to the Emergency Communication Network (ECN) system.\n\n\nWhat sort of things can I get a fined for?\nFor a complete list of finable offenses and misdemeanors applicable in your current jurisdiction, please consult your mobiGlas.\n\n\nWhy did I receive a fine for something legal elsewhere?\nCertain jurisdictions have different laws. You should always check the legality of your cargo when entering a new jurisdiction.\n\n\nMy ship was stolen, why am I still receiving fines?\nUnless you report your vehicle stolen to law enforcement (this can be easily done at an ASOP terminal), you are still considered the legal owner of the ship and are responsible for certain crimes perpetrated by it.\n\n\nWhat are Escalated Fines?\nTo encourage prompt payment, the Office of Imperial Justice (OIJ) provides offenders a short period where newly acquired fines may be settled at a discounted rate. If payment is not made before this period expires, the fine escalates in both price and severity.\n\n\nWhat happens if I don’t pay my Escalated Fines?\nIf you accumulate enough unpaid escalated fines you will be issued a crimestat. The heavier your escalated fines, the faster this will happen. The OIJ strongly urges everyone to pay their fines regularly and on time.\n\n\nWhat if I receive a fine in error?\nIf you think you have received a fine in error, please contact the Issue Council. While mistakes are rare, we are trying to improve the system all the time and your feedback is welcome.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_corsair_desc=We at Drake Interplanetary know that sometimes defense isn’t just about protecting what’s yours. Sometimes it’s about striking out and facing the unknown head-on. How can you ever be truly safe if you don’t know what threat is waiting beyond the next mountain range, moon, or jump point? \n\nThanks to a large hold capable of stowing a small vehicle and specially designed asymmetric convertible wings, the Corsair adapts gracefully to unfamiliar atmospheres, combat situations, and hot landing zones. Be ready for anything, and you’ll never be caught unprepared.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_g12_desc=While larger vehicles like the Tumbril Nova and Anvil Ballista may be better known for their military might, the UEE deploys thousands of smaller tactical vehicles in defense of the Empire. More easily transported to provide greater mission flexibility, these rovers and gravlevs often allow tactical responsiveness to a wider variety of terrain and scenarios. When atmospheric conditions become hostile and can impede flight, having a varied motor pool at your disposal can make all the difference.\n\nOne of the newest rovers to join the ranks is the G12a from Origin Jumpworks. While it may have the sleek lines the manufacturer is known for, the G12a is reinforced with heavier armor and fortified wheels, and comes armed with a full defensive and offensive suite. When deployed, it will initially serve as a patrol vehicle for landing sites located in active combat areas with severe weather patterns.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_hercules_desc=The first active-duty starlifter flight was formed in May 2821, when Crusader Industries delivered a dozen Hercules ships during that year’s Invictus Launch Week. Capable of deploying armored vehicles in the midst of heavy enemy fire, the Hercules proved invaluable to battlefield operations. This was apparent on March 2824, when UEE armed forces were called upon to put down a heavily armed group of pirate forces located on a frontier world near the Xi’an border. Two Hercules squadrons, escorted by deep space support fighters, quietly deployed troops and an armored column which defeated the stunned criminal forces in short order. The battle, previously thought to be a particularly hazardous prospect, was won with no losses of UEE personnel and the resulting capture of information would lead directly to the destruction of two pirate outposts and a small capital ship.\n\nWith the recent reintroduction of the Tumbril Nova Tank, the Navy’s fleet of Hercules Starlifters has become busier than ever. However, delivering ground combat vehicles is far from the Hercules’ only task during the ongoing war against the Vanduul. With roads destroyed during the course of attacks, the Hercules Starlifter was a vital part in rescue operations on Urial, rapidly flying in earthmovers and cranes to assist in saving countless lives that would have otherwise perished in the rubble. Logistic vehicles like the Hercules are crucial in the Navy’s ability to respond to the shifting needs of the Empire. \n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_kraken_desc=The Kraken has been released and that means one thing, there’s no putting it back. This attack carrier has changed the way militias operate forever and, when it comes to personal defense, there’s one thing you never want to be - falling behind.\n\nA protector and a beacon of freedom in an often-cruel universe, Drake Interplanetary has made this capital-class ship available to all those tasked with safekeeping those unable to protect themselves. The Kraken is both a sanctuary and a self-contained war machine ready to take on the most daunting adversaries.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_mercury_desc=Good intel is the key to victory. That’s why the UEE Navy is seeking to increase the presence of the Crusader Industries Mercury Star Runner in its fleet this year. Already battle proven on several classified missions, the Mercury has delivered key strategic updates to our forces along the front, including Admiral Bishop himself, that have been the key to multiple hard-earned victories. Especially in “red systems” where comm networks may be non-existent, the Mercury’s ability to carry classified encrypted information has been a boon time and again.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to Crusader’s inclusion of a programmable kill switch and optimized security configurations, there is a significantly reduced chance of highly classified information falling into enemy hands. Pair that with the Mercury’s speed, precision, and cutting-edge countermeasures, it becomes easy to see why Navy Intelligence Officers have come to rely on this star runner for ensuring that information is delivered on time and intact. \n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nautilus_desc=First introduced nearly four centuries ago, Aegis Dynamics’ Nautilus has made an indelible mark upon the Navy’s long and proud history, but it is just as needed today as when it was introduced during the First Tevarin War. The Nautilus has played a crucial role in the ongoing Vanduul War, using its minelaying capabilities to set up perimeter defenses and define the shape of the conflict.  \n\nOne such example is the mission known as the ‘Hellkite Run’ that was part of Operation Mandrake in the Oberon system. Flown by sapper specialists Squadron 761, aka the Alley Vipers, Nautilus minelayers were used to severely limit the Vanduul escape options. Working tirelessly while the main fleet engaged with enemy forces, they were able to deploy pockets of mines and weapon platforms with such precision that an entire Vanduul squadron was eliminated before they could escape the system to cause additional harm.\n
fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nautilus_title=Aegis Dynamics Nautilus
fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nova_desc=First utilized in the Second Tevarin War, the Nova tank has made a triumphant return to battle in 2948 thanks to efforts of the recently reformed manufacturer Tumbril. Military Historians still recount the original Nova’s performance at the 2605 Battle of Koren Pass where three Nova tanks held off an entire Tevarin strike team for over sixteen hours. While much credit is due to the brave soldiers who fought so valiantly, it is hard to deny that the Nova’s resilience and ferocity allowed for the UEE to prevail that day.\n\nThough they are most commonly found in the Army’s arsenal, you’ll find that Nova tanks are playing a pivotal role in the Navy’s combat operations, protecting tactical encampments across the Vanduul front. Its mobility means that it can quickly and effectively redeploy to provide combat support where needed and its resistance to extreme temperatures mean that the Nova can be posted in any number of environments. Knowing they’re protected by the Nova’s battery of arms allows pilots and starmen to work more effectively and creates a safer Empire.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_polaris_desc=One of the newest capital ships serving in the fleet, the Polaris-class corvette entered service in 2946 and has already made a big impact on the Empire. Thanks to the vessel's well-balanced mix of power and speed, it has enhanced the Navy’s overall effectiveness in a wide variety of scenarios, from delivering Humanitarian aid to tactical operations.  \n\nUnder the command of Captain Lucia Franco, the UEES Polaris has shown how essential the corvette’s adaptability is to the ongoing war effort. Recently of note, the Polaris and her crew were on extended patrol in Tayac when they successfully halted an attempted incursion by a Vanduul scouting party, potentially deterring further enemy action in that sector for the foreseeable future. Cpt. Franco attributed the vessel’s above-average quality of life standards to the combat effectiveness of her starmen.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_redeemer_desc=There are few ships that are awaiting deployment as eagerly as the Aegis Dynamics Redeemer. After being featured at two previous Invictus Launch Weeks, the Navy is closer than ever to utilizing the full potential of this cutting-edge gunship. The UEEN has worked closely with Aegis to perfect the Redeemer during this time to ensure that it will meet and exceed all the operational needs of such an advanced vessel. From the early reports arriving from various test squadrons, including the famous 999, the Redeemer is going to be worth the wait. \n\nDesigned to carry significant cargo and troops, the Redeemer will provide support in a variety of combat situations and logistical operations. The state-of-the-art technology employed by Aegis should make the craft one of the easiest to maintain to operational-effective standards. Additionally, the boarding hatch will permit faster transitions in situ while the VectorLock thruster design will allow for optimal maneuvering via its twin nacelles. High Command is eager to see what the Redeemer can do once it finds its way into the hands of enthusiastic pilots across the Naval fleet.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_taurus_desc=Invictus Launch Week celebrates the Navy’s best and brightest, but no celebration would be complete without mention of the hardworking crews aboard the UEE Merchant Navy fleet. These civilian-owned vessels are a vital part of the military supply chain and work tirelessly to ensure that those serving along the frontlines have the provisions they need. For years, the Merchant Navy has relied upon the RSI Constellation Taurus to successfully complete those dangerous runs through hostile territory.\n\nWith a streamlined chassis that can handle more cargo than any other Constellation variant, the Taurus allows each run to be maximized for efficiency. However, it still provides security above many similar freighters thanks to its utilization of defensive technology developed by RSI for its more military focused ships. One Merchant Navy Taurus, the Aliwent, is a particularly welcome sight for the brave starmen serving at listening posts in Kellog, delivering supplies and much needed care packages. It’s no wonder that many captains are eagerly waiting for the 2951 Taurus to be brought into service.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_vulture_desc=There’s no denying it - winning can be messy business. When your fleet of Drake ships is done laying waste to the latest batch of outlaws who were foolhardy enough to tangle with you and your people, there’s going to be no shortage of wreckage to wade through. \n\nThat’s where the Vulture comes in. No need to leave behind a veritable junkyard around your station or homestead for criminals to use as cover next time they attack; the Vulture can help you clean it all up and then some. Forget just clearing the way, salvage pays. What better way to defend yourself than to have the broken ships of your enemies pay for your next round of ammunition? Sounds like a fitting end to us.\n

We want you to find and eliminate a Hurston lackey named ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nDetails containing their last known sighting around ~mission(Location|Address) will be provided. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_timed_001=Word spreads fast around here. Don't wait too long on this, or you might lose the element of surprise. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_002=For the sake of the movement, it's vital this gets done soon. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_003=There's chatter that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is planning something big. You've got to stop them before it's too late. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_004=We need you to move fast on this. Who knows what the target is working on. 
hdactivist_assassination_title_001=Real Criminal Justice
hdactivist_assassination_title_002=Level the Playing Field
hdactivist_assassination_title_003=Retribution
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_001=They aren't expecting you, but don't think for a second this is going to be easy. Those bastards love to fight. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_002=Make sure you have more than enough ammo. There's no way to know how many of 'em will be down there. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_003=Make sure you're armed up and prepared for war. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_004=I'm not gonna lie, this will get bloody, but that's what we have to do to secure our future. 
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_001=Recently, Hurston security forces have been increasingly more violent to anyone voicing opposition to their authority. We've tried all legal channels, but it seems that an equally aggressive response will be the only way they'll hear us. I'm looking to pay someone to deliver that message.\n\nWe've learned that security forces have been operating out of ~mission(Location|Address). I'll send you the coordinates. You go in and clear it out. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger)\n\nHopefully there will be a day where we can resolve this through rational discourse, but they've made it clear that it is not today.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_002=Looking for a heavy hitter interested in some serious action. ~mission(Location|Address) is crawling with corrupt, armed assholes working for Hurston. I need them gone, pronto. Don't care how you handle it, only that it gets done. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\nDo this right and you'll be compensated accordingly.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_003=If you found this, it's probably safe to say that you have an axe to grind with Hurston. I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of waiting for things to magically get better. What we need are bold actions to show Hurston that the status quo must go. \n\nThat's why I dug up some info about ~mission(Location|Address). It's where corporate thugs hang out and plan their attacks on the people of Hurston. Clearing that location would send a bold message to Corporate that we're willing to fight fire with fire. You interested? \n\nIt'll be dangerous, but you'll be paid well. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_004=We got intel on ~mission(Location|Address) that says it's staffed with corporate thugs. We aren't just going to sit around and wait for them to crack down on our brothers and sisters who are just trying to make Hurston a better place to live. I don't have the skills to handle this type of op, but I've got the creds to fund it. Interested? \n\nShould go without saying, but this job will be highly dangerous. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep)A lot of good people will get hurt if someone doesn't stop them.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_005=Looking for someone who's willing to fight for what's right. For far too long Hurston has used violence to keep its people in line. Now it's time to show them that their intimidation tactics won't go unanswered.\n\nI've recently obtained intel that's identified ~mission(Location|Address) as being key to their security operations. Anyone willing to clear out the location will be doing the people of Hurston a great service. It'll be risky, but I'll also make sure you're paid well for your trouble. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_001=One of the smugglers we work with on occasion, ~mission(TargetName), refuses to complete our arranged delivery unless we triple our agreed-upon payment. As you can imagine, we can't allow their greed to endanger the movement, nor can we afford to pay their unreasonable demands. \n\nInstead, we're hopeful that you'll be able to track them down for us and forcefully retrieve our rightful property. Once you successfully bring the shipment to ~mission(Destination|Address), we will gladly give you the credits we had originally promised ~mission(TargetName|Last). \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_002=Recently, one of our much needed supply runs got hit by an outlaw. Before our hauler died, they managed to confirm the identity of their attacker - ~mission(TargetName).\n\nWe need you to hunt this bastard down and take back what's ours. And of course we'll pay you for delivering the supplies to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) betrayed us. \n\nAn important shipment we had smuggled in to ~mission(Destination|Address) went missing a few days ago and we were finally able to track it down. One of our operatives, ~mission(TargetName|Last), had stolen it.\n\nWe need that traitor tacked down and the shipment brought back. Do whatever you need to.  \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_004=Hurston Security is taking active action to cut off our supply routes. They're even turning a blind eye to outlaws in the area as long as it's our ships being attacked. We need to respond before our resources are completely cut off. \n\nWe've been able to track down the location of one of these outlaws, ~mission(TargetName). Bring the stolen goods aboard their ship back to ~mission(Destination|Address). I don't expect ~mission(TargetName|Last) will give it up without a fight.\n\nHopefully this'll show Hurston that we will not back down.\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_title_001=Restocking Supplies
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_001=Things could get dangerous. Gear up just in case. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_002=Watch yourself out there. Pretty sure Hurston will do whatever it takes to keep us from getting this thing. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_003=Fair warning, but security might be at the site. If they come after you, do what's necessary to get that crate. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_004=As always, a gig like this can be dangerous. So plan for the worst, hope for the best, right? 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_005=Be careful. Security could be all over that location. 
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_001=Got information on the location of a certain package that would greatly help our cause. We're looking for someone willing to hit up ~mission(Location|Address), retrieve the item, and deliver it to ~mission(Destination|Address). Interested? \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_002=Want to support a good cause and earn some solid creds? \n\nIf so, then help us get our hands on specific crate that's supposed to be in ~mission(Location|Address). If you find the crate and bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address), I'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_003=There's a growing movement focused on making Hurston a better place and we need some help. We've been tracking a certain item for some time that could help our cause in multiple ways. With Hurston's recent escalation of oppression, we believe now is the time to acquire it for ourselves, but with security forces watching our every move, we need someone else to collect it from ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nIf you bring the crate to ~mission(Destination|Address), we'll pay you a price commensurate with your troubles. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed)  \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_004=Recently, Hurston fabricated charges against a hauler working for us in order to confiscate a very important delivery. Their actions aren't legal, even by Hurston standards, but they don't care and we can't wait attain it through legal channels. That's why I'm looking to pay someone to do it for us.\n\nAn insider who's sympathetic to our cause claims it ended up in ~mission(Location|Address). I'll send you the exact coordinates. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\nOnce you have the crate, bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address) and I'll transfer the creds. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_005=The Lorville customs office claims to have lost a crate that was being sent to us by a prominent supporter outside the system. I've got it on good authority that's a lie. Those Hurston bastards simply seized it to mess with us. I can't let this injustice stand and hope you're willing to help right this wrong.\n\nI just got word that they moved the crate to ~mission(Location|Address). I need someone to find this thing and bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)I'll make sure you're paid well for all your trouble.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_006=I need your help. An old friend was desperate for work, so I threw him a gig hauling a valuable item for us. Turns out he had an active crime stat, and Hurston Security arrested him before he could make the delivery. Now I'm in hot water. That crate needs to get to ~mission(Destination|Address) or I'm screwed.\n\nI pulled a few strings and discovered that the cargo actually ended up in ~mission(Location|Address). I'll pay you if you can retrieve it for me and make the delivery. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum**
