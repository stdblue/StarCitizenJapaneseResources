Journal_General_Healing_Content=Since its recent introduction, there’s no denying that regeneration technology has changed modern medicine for the better. Across the Empire, patients can now recover from injuries that would have been fatal in the past. However, as impressive as regeneration is, it is not a replacement for traditional care and treatments.\n\nBelow, we will outline a few important tips on regeneration along with some basic medical practices to help safeguard your health.\n\n--REGENERATION--\n\nRegeneration is the medical process in which a holistic bioscan known as an ‘imprint’ is used to recreate a near perfect copy of someone down to their memories. Because of the unique properties of the imprint, it maintains a remote connection to its source at all times and ensures that it can only regenerate someone after they experience a fatal event. \n\nThis connection, known as an ‘echo’, also means that traumatic experiences lower an Imprint’s Viability Score (IVS). Repeated regeneration may produce irregularities during the regeneration process and eventually render the imprint unusable.    \n\nTo create your very own imprint, visit a Tier 1 or Tier 2 medical facility and register on a kiosk. Once complete, that site will then be where you next regenerate. You can also store an imprint aboard a properly equipped vehicle. If the location or vehicle where your imprint is stored becomes unavailable, a back-up will always be available at your primary residence and you will regenerate there. Please note that having an active CrimeStat may have an impact on your regeneration site.\n\nHowever, because of the effect of imprint echoes on the regeneration process, it is important to remember that receiving first aid and medical treatment is always preferable to being regenerated.  The following breakdown outlines basic first aid to deal with a variety of injuries to help avoid needing to regenerate.\n\n--FIRST AID--\n\nThe first step when dealing with an injury is to identify how serious it is using a visor HUD, a self-evaluation (i.e. PIT), or if assisting someone else, a medical device. All injuries can be divided into three severity categories:\n\n- Minor injuries can be treated by Tier 3 (T3) medical facilities and are highlighted purple.\n\n- Moderate injuries can be treated Tier 2 (T2) medical facilities and are highlighted mauve.\n\n- Severe injuries can be treated by Tier 1 (T1) medical facilities and are highlighted pink.\n\nTo fully treat an injury, seek out an appropriately tiered facility at a rest stop, landing zone, or medically equipped vehicle. Attempting treatment at an incorrectly tiered facility can temporarily relieve symptoms, but the injury itself will remain. If you are alone and in need of transportation to a medical facility, you should contact a trusted acquaintance or use your mobiGlas to create a rescue service beacon.\n\nWhile injuries can only be treated at an appropriate medical facility, medication can be administered on site to temporarily alleviate associated symptoms. Before heading out a trip, it’s smart to bring along single dose pens, medical attachments, or full healing device with you.\n\nInjection pens are easy to carry and administer, but you will need to bring multiple pens to cover various symptoms and they can only be used once.\n\nSmaller medical attachments, like the LifeGuard for the Pyro Multi-Tool, allow for diagnostic scans and can administer a healing agent like Hemozal, but cannot treat other symptoms. They are typically used in conjunction with injection pens. \n\nFull medical devices like the ParaMed from CureLife provide detailed diagnostic scans and allows for the administration of multiple medicines along with full control of the dosage. However, it can be bulkier and more expensive than other options.\n\nFor ease of reference, here is an alphabetical list of common symptoms and the recommended medicines to relieve them.\n\n--COMMON SYMPTOMS--\n\n- Concussion – Caused by an impact to the head, individuals with a concussion will experience slower reaction times and have a harder time maintaining their balance. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine. \n\n- Health Loss – As displayed on your mobiGlas or bioscan, your ‘health’ is a simplified diagnostic number derived by combining information from several important monitored vitals. Sustaining injuries will cause you to lose health. Health can be restored by administering a healing agent like Hemozal.\n\n- Impaired Mobility – Caused by injuries to the limbs, torso or head, impaired mobility will make getting around difficult. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Incapacitation – Individuals who are incapacitated have had their health levels reduced to zero and will be unable to move. This is a potentially fatal condition and a healing agent like Hemozal must be applied must be applied in order to restore mobility. The amount of time until the condition is irreversible will be displayed on your mobiGlas. Note that factors like sustaining additional injures or having other confounding medical issues may impact how long you have. \n\n- Muscle Fatigue – Caused by injuries to the limbs, those suffering from muscle fatigue will move slower and have their refined motor skills affected. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine.  \n\n- Muscle Weakness – Caused by injuries to the arms, muscle weakness makes it difficult to do activities the require strength. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Ocular Inflammation – Caused by injuries to the head and results in vision obscured by inflamed blood vessels. Can be relieved by a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Partial Paralysis – Caused by injures to the limbs, partial paralysis makes it so the affected area is severely impaired resulting in the loss of the ability to do activities like running, climbing, and interacting with objects. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Respiratory Damage – Caused by injuries to the torso, this affects lung capacity and makes breathing or prolonged physical exertion very difficult. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Stunned – A temporary loss of consciousness that leaves the individual unable to move for the duration. Will relieve itself after enough time passes and consciousness is regained.\n\n--BLOOD DRUG LEVEL AND OVERDOSE RISK—\n\nWhile giving first aid is vital, know that it comes with its own risks. Administering medication will increase an individual’s Blood Drug Level (BDL) as will imbibing recreational drugs or alcohol. \n\nA high BDL can create a feeling of intoxication and may result in difficulty moving, blurred vision, and loss of refined motor skills. For your safety and other, it is strongly recommended that you avoid operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n\nOnce your BDL reaches a dangerous level it is called an overdose. Individuals experiencing an overdose will be stunned and will gradually lose health until they become incapacitated.\n\nFortunately, BDL will reduce naturally over time. Administering a detoxicant like Resurgera will speed the process and make it so you are no longer stunned. \n

Journal_General_Medical_Content=Whether you haven’t been sleeping well, experienced a traumatic injury, or have , most modern digital assistants like mobiGlas include a wide variety of health monitoring capabilities to make staying healthy simpler than ever.\n\nBy constantly monitoring your key vitals, the software is able to make preliminary diagnoses and alert you about dozens of afflictions you may be experiencing. These alerts, when used properly, can offer guidance and help you know when to make lifestyle adjustments, administer self-treatment options, or seek assistance from a medical professional.  \n\nBelow we have highlighted a few of the more common medical alerts that you may see:\n\nConcussed -\nA mild brain injury that results in temporary loss of cognitive function. Early warning signs of a concussion can include double vision, loss of balance, and ringing in the ears.\n\nDehydrated - \nWhen the body does not have enough water to function normally. Symptoms can include thirst, dry mouth, headaches, deteriorating health, exhaustion, and blurred vision.\n\nHemorrhage - \nInternal or external bleeding. It is recommended that you try to stem the loss of blood as soon as possible to minimize deterioration of health.\n\nHyperthermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has risen above safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards fatigue, severe headaches and migraines, difficulty breathing, deteriorating health, and increased thirst. \n\nHypothermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has fallen below safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards severe fatigue, shivering, weakness of the limbs, deteriorating health, increased appetite, light sensitivity, hearing impairment and a risk of paradoxical undressing.\n\nMalnourished - \nWhen the body does not have enough nutrients to function normally. Symptoms can include weakness, deteriorating health, irritability, hearing and vision impairment.   \n\nSevere Injury - \nA general term used to describe when very serious trauma has been inflicted to the body. Often accompanied by vision loss. Requires immediate medical attention.\n\nUnconscious -\nWhen trauma is severe enough, an individual may experience a syncope, lose consciousness and become unable to respond to stimuli. \n\n

Journal_General_Nutrition_Content=We all lead busy lives, and sometimes making good nutrition choices can be a daunting challenge to say the least! \n\nThankfully, by using the NDR and HEI ratings assigned to most commercially available food and drinks, taking better care of yourself has never been easier. Just remember, the *higher* the score, the better the nutrition, and the better you'll feel. \n\nNutritional Density Rating (NDR)\nDevised by Empire Health Services to help people eat healthier, the Nutritional Density Rating (NDR) takes into consideration the food’s concentration of nutrients per 100kcal, the breadth and diversity of nutrients contained, and the nutritional bioavailability. The higher an NDR score, the better a food item is for your overall health. However, it is important to remember that no single food contains all the nutrients a single person needs, so along with eating high-scoring food, the second most important thing an individual can do is consume a wide variety of foods. Here’s to good eating and good health! \n\nHydration Efficacy Index (HEI)\nOriginally created by a team of nutritionists at the University of Jalan to compare the effects of beverage choice on hydration levels during long haul space flights, the Hydration Efficacy Index (HEI) has since been adapted by Empire Health Services as the standard measure by which various drink selections can be compared. By considering such factors as moisture retention, absorbency rates, osmolality, caloric count, and electrolyte levels (specifically sodium and potassium), a beverage can be graded using one standardized index. The higher the score, the more effective the beverage is at keeping the consumer hydrated for longer. Substances like caffeine and alcohol have the potential to decrease the index score by increasing the rate of water loss from the body. Standard filtration system water has a baseline score of 80. \n\nDietary Effects\nIn addition to the baseline scores, many foods and drinks have been additionally labeled with keywords to provide extra information about the potential effects that item will have on your health. Take a look at the list below for some of the most common effects and what they mean.\n\nHypertrophic - Provides additional blood flow and nutrients to key muscle groups to make them perform optimally.\n\nAtrophic - Restricts blood flow, negatively affecting the muscles, making tasks seem harder.\n\nEnergizing - Provides a boost to your energy levels, allowing you to be active for longer.\n\nFatiguing - Has a draining effect, causing lethargy and general sense of exhaustion.\n\nCognitive Boosting - Encourages brain function by allowing additional focus while performing complicated tasks.\n\nCognitive Impairing - Stymies brain activity making it difficult to focus for long durations. \n\nHypometabolic - Digests slowly, making you feel satisfied for longer.\n\nHypermetabolic - Digests quickly, increasing the likelihood you'll be hungry sooner.\n\nHydrating - Helps your body to better absorb water, allowing you to satisfy your thirst for longer.\n\nDehydrating - Causes your body to lose water, making you thirstier.\n\nHealing - Provides vital nutrients to help your body naturally repair itself. \n\nToxic - Contains elements that are detrimental to your health and can cause damage if consumed in large quantities. \n\nImmune Boosting - Helps your body stay healthy when exposed to harmful elements.\n\nImmune Suppressing - Weakens your body's ability to fight off harmful elements.\n\n\n

Journal_General_StarmapQuantumTutorial_Content=Now that your mobiGlas has installed to the new 2.5 network update, you are ready to use the StarMap app to travel the stars in a whole new way. For the past year, the engineers at microTech have been working with industry-leading quantum drive manufacturers to allow our award winning StarMap app to seamlessly integrate with most consumer navigation software. This means you can now set quantum travel routes directly from inside the Starmap you are ready to use the StarMap to set quantum travel routes directly.  \n\nTo get started using these new features, follow the quickstart guide below.\n\nSafe Travels!\n\nThe StarMap App Dev Team\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nSTARMAP QUANTUM TRAVEL QUICKSTART GUIDE\n\n1. From your cockpit chair, open up the StarMap app either by accessing it through your mobiGlas or your ship’s holo-display.\n\n2. Use the StarMap’s controls to pan and zoom around the map, till you see the destination you wish to travel to. (Remember, you may have to zoom in or out to locate a particular destination.)\n\n3. Click on the destination to see a route from your current location highlighted with a green scrolling dashed line. (If the route is inaccessible by a single quantum, it will appear a red static dashed line. If this is the case, you may have to travel to an accessible location first before traveling to your ultimate destination or refill your quantum fuel tank. For any additional issues, contact your quantum drive manufacturer.) \n\n4. Once you have your route selected, you can use the button on the lower left labeled “Set As Destination” to transfer these coordinates to your quantum drive’s navigational computer. The route will now be highlighted by green scrolling arrows.\n\n5. Close the StarMap and you are now set to begin quantum travel. After spooling your quantum drive in preparation, rotate your ship so that your prow is aimed at the diamond-shaped destination marker on your AR display to calibrate the navigational computer. Once spooled and calibrated, you will be able to initiate quantum to your set location. (Remember, you will not be able to quantum travel again till your drive’s cooldown period ends.)

I know the initial speculation was criminal sabotage, but based on this, it looked like worker negligence. Sad as it is to say.\n \nAnyway, I’ve attached a series of files to help illustrate my points and so you don’t have to sift through three million lines of data text.\n \n**/Excerpt_1 ATTACHED/**\n \nI’ve pulled together some sample readings from the Power Distribution logs. As you can see, over the past year, the station has been suffering from sporadic power drains. Maintenance reports theorized that there was a power drain somewhere, but to me, it looks like faulty switchers. These 2920’s were notorious for power flow issues.\n \n**/Excerpt_2 ATTACHED/**\n \nSo here is the initial stress test that Darnell Ward ran the day of the incident. Everything after <i>RUNPROTOCOL stresstest_v3.dnn</i> is the test taking effect. Everything looks good, right? Then, and I haven’t figured out why yet, but a few hours later (and in the middle of the stress test) he runs this <i>all_monitor_silence.dnn</i> protocol. Maybe he was trying to bring monitoring systems offline to see if they were causing the drain. I don’t really know. Anyway, it was a stupid move, because he basically removed his only way to see that the power plant was about to go critical. \n \nI’ll keep digging and keep you apprised.\n \nDennis

LingFamily_Danger_001=Also, some of the family has run into trouble doing similar contracts recently. I would be extra careful. You know it's dangerous when cousin Maggi even says it. 
LingFamily_Danger_002=Also, a word of caution. I've got several reports highlighting this particular stretch as potentially dangerous. I don't think anything will happen, but just be ready in case trouble shows up. 
LingFamily_Danger_003=One more thing. I don't want to raise a false alarm, but there's a small chance that this contract may wind up being riskier than usual. Nothing concrete, but I've got a contact in Crusader Security who gave me a heads up. Should be fine, but be careful. 
LingFamily_Danger_004=And I probably don't have to say this, but Crusader's been having some security issues lately. It's not as safe as it once was, especially where you'll be going for this job. Be smart out there and stay safe. 
LingFamily_Family_001=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but unfortunately his cooler blew. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can step in. 
LingFamily_Family_002=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but his power plant's been having issues. He's getting it fixed, it'd be great if you can take this one. 
LingFamily_Family_003=My brother, Ricki, was scheduled to handle this, but the quantum drive on his Lancer decided to stop working today. It's being repaired, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can handle it. 
LingFamily_Family_004=My brother, Ricki, is down for the count today owing to his life support system being on its last breath. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can fill in. 
LingFamily_Family_005=Ricki got caught up on the opposite side of Stanton doing a long haul, so we need someone else to handle this job. 
LingFamily_Family_006=I originally had Ricki slated for this, but a leaky fuel line means he's not going to get back in time. Hopefully, you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_007=Fabian, my cousin, commed in sick again. Guess his suit actuator failed while he was doing a drop on Yela and he caught a cold. So we need someone to pick up the slack today. 
LingFamily_Family_008=Got a last minute comm from my cousin Fabian that he isn't feeling well again. Seems he picked up a stomach bug from a bad burrito and can't fly. Would be great if you could cover for him. 
LingFamily_Family_009=Hoping that you'll be able to fill in for my cousin Fabian. Not sure exactly what happened, but seems like his arm is on the fritz and he can't fly till he sees a cybernetician. You'll definitely be helping us out if you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_010=You ever hear of Dolphin Tongue? Well, my cousin Fabian woke up with it. Half his face is swollen to the size of burstmelon. Would you be free to take over for him today? 
LingFamily_Family_011=My cousin Maggi had some trouble with the Nine Tails and is filing a report with Crusader right now. Of course, that could wind up taking all afternoon so I need someone to handle this job for her. 
LingFamily_Family_012=I thought that my cousin Maggi was going to be able to do this one, but she has to chase down a missing order. Hoping that it wasn't stolen. Either way, she's going to be tied up for a while. 
LingFamily_Family_013=Fabian caught a stomach bug and now the rest of the family seems to have got it. To be honest, I'm not feeling so great, but I'm hanging in for now. Since they're all busy making their own "deliveries" until the medicine kicks in, I was thinking you might be able to take care of this job. 
LingFamily_Family_014=A bunch of the family headed over to New Babbage for the day to celebrate another cousin's birthday. And guess who didn't get to go? Anyway, still plenty of work around here that needs doing.

LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_001=After that last contract, how many screw ups was that? You know what? I don't want to scold you like you're some kid. I'm just gonna say do better and leave it at that. 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_002=Seems like you've been having a really hard time getting through these contracts. Last few jobs we've thrown you're way haven't exactly gone as planned. We're not a big company so these setbacks really hurt our bottom line. You're just going to have to do better, okay? Having said that... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Guess you're a diamond in the rough, after all. Had a bet going with my sister Linda that you would screw up that last contract. Now I have to make her dinner, but hey, it's better than having to clean up your mess again. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Way to turn it around. I was getting worried about you, but that last contract showed you got potential. We'll have to see if you can keep it up... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_001=Rough time on that last contract, huh? It happens. Important thing is not focus on it too much, and get back out there - 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_002=Hard to say exactly where you went wrong on that last contract, but it wasn't pretty. Let's do better this time, Okay? 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=Got to say, you've really been killing it out there. Even Davi's been impressed and he's been doing this for decades. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=I'm starting to think we got pretty lucky finding you. You've been giving Ling Family Hauling a good name out there with all the recent work you've been doing for us. Speaking of... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=That last contract got away from you or what? Don't worry though. Screwing up every once in a while is what being part of the Ling Family is all about. (Don't tell them I said that.) 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=Tough break on that last job. Can't be perfect all the time, I guess. Unless your my sister Linda. But let's not talk about her right now... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_001=You did good on that last contract. Nice stuff. 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_002=Real quick, wanted to mention the last contract you did. Saw that it went well. Good work. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So far, I think as a whole, Ling Family Hauling has been more than fair with you. But this contract is the end. Either you get it right, or we're done working with you. That simple. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_002=Listen, this contract here? This is your last chance. We can't afford to risk any more business on you unless you find a way to turn things around. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_001=Okay. So, I'm gonna tell you straight. If it had been up to me, we would have burned your contact, but dad seems to think you deserve another chance, so here we are... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_002=Here's what's happening. We had a family meeting and decided that maybe you deserve another chance. I hope you make the most of it. That said... 
LingFamily_Timed_001=Unfortunately, we're on a bit of a tight schedule with this one. Need it taken care of ASAP. 
LingFamily_Timed_002=Be sure to keep in mind that this job has a firm deadline. Not much wiggle room. 
LingFamily_Timed_003=Make sure to keep an eye on clock when you're out there. Don't want you missing the deadline. 
LingFamily_Timed_004=Make sure to be mindful of the time while you're working. Our business depends on us being punctual. 
LingFamily_UGF_collect_desc_001=Hey,\n\nWe need you to grab a delivery for us over at ~mission(Location|Address) and then take it to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nI was originally going to send my brother Ricki to handle this, but he said the area’s too dangerous.

MTProtection_RepUI_Description=When the city of New Babbage was first designed, microTech had hoped that they would be able to use advanced monitoring systems combined with automatic response units to handle most security issues that would arise.

MilesEckhart_IntroCommLawful_1=[PH] Hey, how are you? Miles Eckhart, Eckhart Security. A friend over at Crusader Security said you've building quite a rep. I run a modest security outfit and am always on the lookout for capable people who don't rattle. If you're interested in picking up some extra work, we should talk. I'll send my details.
MilesEckhart_IntroInPersonLawful_1=[PH] Hey there, sport. Grab a seat. Sorry for the locale, don't look like much but the homemade stuff has some kick. Anyway, I've been hearing good things about you. Real stand-up sort. Just the type of people I like to know. As I mentioned, I run a small security outfit, we handle all sorts of ops, so I'm always on the lookout for people who know how to handle themselves in a scrap.
MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCaptorsattackersWhilstKeepingHostagesattackedAlive_2=[PH] We've just been hired to retrieve another poor bastard who's been abducted. Same drill as before, keep the hostage alive, whatever happens to the captors happens.
MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCriminal_2=[PH] Another bounty came over the spec if you're interested. Have a look.
MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCriminal_4=[PH] This one came straight from the Guild. It's a high value, high risk target. Watch yourself with this one.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_1=[PH] A contract just came through to go look into several ship wrecks in the area. One problem. The people responsible for making the wrecks are still in the area and they might take issue with you, so expect a fight.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_3=[PH] High risk retrieval just came in. Check out out the details and see if you're interested, otherwise I'll pass it along.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_1=[PH] Been getting a lot of requests to chase down ship wrecks. Usually they're a sleepwalk, but they can get dicey real quick depending on which area they're sending you to. I'll send you the request from the insurance company, just follow their instructions and collect your creds.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_3=[PH] Guess some idiot pilot went and got themself killed, so we've got another contract to find the wreck.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackageInAGivenTime_2=[PH] Just got pinged from another delivery. It's time sensitive so don't take the gig if you can't make the deadline.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackages_2=[PH] Need another delivery if you got the time.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDropOffAndPickUpItems_1=[PH] This one's gonna be a hand-off. Client's a bit worried about the folks on the other side of the deal, so figured a little muscle to handle the trade would be smart. It'll be on you to make sure the transfer runs smooth as ice.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_1=[PH] An escort job just tumbled free and wondered if you might be available. Should be easy money, but keep your eyes open.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_2=[PH] Need a babysitter for a ship run. Take a look and see if you're interested.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_1=[PH] It's a basic escort mission, the client's got a handful of stops they need to make. You follow and keep them out of trouble. Not too tough, right?
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_1=[PH] We've gotten word that an assault's building against some honest-to-god law-abiding folks and they need some help. Pay's not great, but hey, it's not always about the money, right? I'm kidding.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_1=[PH] We've got a target that we need to take down. I've coordinated with local law and bounty hunters so it's totally above board. Anyway, you aren't going to be able to take them in a stand up fight, so you'll need to trap them.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2=[PH] Got another scumbag who's ready for the swift hand of justice... and worth a sizeable bounty. Up for another ambush?
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_1=[PH] Here's the deal, I've managed to secure a retainer for local law enforcement agencies. I just got word that they're moving on some criminal elements and want some backup.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2=[PH] Another chaffeur job just came across the spec. Have a look and see if you're interested.
MilesEckhart_LawfulRecoverStolenCargoGuardedByCriminals_2=[PH] Law enforcement and Advocacy have been cracking down on cargo theft across the systems and are paying operators for the safe retrieval of stolen cargo. Anyway, I put the squeeze on a couple local scumbags and got a line on some hot merch in the area.
MilesEckhart_LawfulSearchAWreckForCorpseOrEvidence_1=[PH] This job's a retrieval op. Need to collect a special bit of- let's say "salvage." I'm gonna give you the honor of going to the wreck, and finding it.
MilesEckhart_MissionFail_6=[PH] The whole thing's gone div and I'm left holding the stick. Hope you're proud of yourself. 
MilesEckhart_OncePlayerSits_1=[PH] So... don't look like much, do ya? Just kidding. So here's my boilerplate pitch, Eckhart Security handles escorts, VIP protection, hostile extractions and even some militia work when they can afford us. Anyway, a job came in late last night. Some idiot hauler thought it'd be a good idea to shave some flight time by cutting through low-sec space and got his crew vented. Company needs to retrieve the ship's blackbox to claim insurance on the lost cargo. Should be a romper job: get in, get out, but all my people are tied up with bigger ops, so I figured I could use this as a chance to make a new friend. I'll send the details, look them over on your own time and if you're interested, hit me back.
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Association=Eckhart Security
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Biography=After leaving the Army, Miles Eckhart missed the excitement of his former life and decided to try mercenary work. He took to it so well that before long he started his own company, Eckhart Security. Specializing in operations in unclaimed and hostile systems like Nyx, Miles remains fully independent and unaffiliated with the Mercenary Guild.
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Location=Lorville, Hurston, Stanton System
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Occupation=CEO, Security Consultant
MilesEckhart_RevisitYoureCurrentlyOnAMission_2=[PH] You got the details, so get moving.
MilesEckhart_SitsInTheCornerOfTheDarkBarHePerksUpWhenHeSeesYou_1=[PH] Hey! Over here. How you been? Grab a seat. Come on. Get in here....
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtPrisonHard_2=[PH] Got a dangerous one for you. Probably the less I talk about it the better.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_1=[PH] Seems one of our clients has been picked up by some two-bit security outfit who fancy themselves real do-gooders. Anyway, our enterprise doesn't benefit with this client incarcerated, so I need you to get them out.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_3=[PH] I swear, I don't know how some of these idiots have stayed alive long enough to make enough money to keep us on retainer. Anyway, we've got another client cooling their heels in a low-sec clink. You free to boost them?
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulKillInnocentOrRivalCriminal_3=[PH] Hey killer, feel like earning some extra creds? Got another target that's living on borrowed breath.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_2=[PH] Since they're in the stealing mood, I figure no one will mind if we help ourselves. If they do, I trust you'll handle them.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_1=[PH] Clients are looking for someone to track down some ships they lost. I don't know if they're trying to retrieve evidence before the law does or what. To be honest, I didn't ask.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackageInAGivenTime_1=[PH] Contact of mine just hit me up. He's got some product he needs moved quick and quiet. I'm talking invisible here, no scans, no checkpoints. You get pinched with this, you're on your own.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackages_2=[PH] Need some low profile product that needs to be moved. I'd skirt any heavy security scans if you get my meaning.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffABomb_2=[PH] Exciting news, slick. Something needs blowing up, and you get to be the lucky one to do it. 
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffAndPickUpItems_2=[PH] So one of my shakier clients is a little nervous and wants us to handle a hand-off. You give 'em ours. We take theirs. And if they try anything... well, you take care of it.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_2=[PH] You free for another protection op? Got a client who needs a heavy hitter on their wing.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_2=[PH] You got time for an escort op? It's another staggered one so you'll hit multiple spots. Have a look.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustFindOnemultipleItemsByScavengingOrKillingAndLootingNoHelpIsGivenFindingTheItems_1=[PH] Got a retrieval op for you. Now, you should know that the owners of the items in question are going to be resistent to the idea of giving up their cargo. I trust you'll be able to change their mind.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_2=[PH] So one of my more - lets say verbal - clients has apparently pissed off the wrong people. Needs some protection and defenses laid down to help in case they retaliate. Hoping you could handle it.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2=[PH] Got another name that needs to be marked off. I've worked out the time and place for the ambush, just need a trigger to do the deed.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_2=[PH] It's another muscle job, back up the client and shoot up whoever they want shot up.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2=[PH] Got another passenger that's looking for low profile transport.

NB_IceSculpture_Desc="Mistakes feed the furnace of innovation." - Magnus Tobin, microTech CEO\n\n\nCreated: 2891\nMaterial: Ice\nArtist: Fay Womak\nDescription: A reflection of the city around it, Sublimate evokes the interplay between cold and creativity that are the hallmarks of life in New Babbage. 
NB_IceSculpture_Name=Sublimate
NB_Plant_Desc_001=Created to be able to survive in near no-light conditions. The resulting altered chlorophyll structure gives the plant its dark coloring and unique woven-like texture. It is hoped that this research will help populate worlds with long night cycles.
NB_Plant_Desc_002=Related to the colocasia, this plant features enormous broad leaves that are pliable and water resistant making it an ideal plastic substitute on remote worlds. Additionally, its sprawling root structure is an edible starch when cooked.
NB_Plant_Desc_003=Derived from a Xi'an desert plant, the many ridges along its trunk are ideal for capturing early morning dew in arid climates. The internal storage cells can collect up to a gallon of drinking water a day in the right conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_004=The unique fractal structure of the violet curcuma's leaves help convert shorter light-waves into a frequency more suitable for photosynthesis. This allows it to flourish in systems where stars are in the later stages of their life and not producing ideal growth light. Its rhizomes also have culinary and medical uses.
NB_Plant_Desc_005=The unique leaves of this palm variant show a huge leap in bio-engineering possibilities thanks to their meticulously designed aerodynamic structure that allows the plant to endure hurricane strength winds.
NB_Plant_Desc_006=This carnivorous plant catches insects with the sticky resin it secretes, allowing it to not only act as an exterminator for unwanted pests, but also survive in severely nitrogen depleted soil.
NB_Plant_Desc_007=The closely woven structure of the Haldor lily provides it with extreme strength and durability. Suitable for planets plagued with torrential storms or swarming insects, this lily is one of the hardier plants ever fabricated.
NB_Plant_Desc_008=With a strong, thin trunk, the sky palm was designed to grow on worlds with thicker atmospheres where it would be able to collect more of the available sunlight at high elevations.
NB_Plant_Desc_009=The thick trunk of this barrel palm tree is able to hold considerable moisture drawn in from the soil offering a possible water conservation solution to settlers living in arid climates.
NB_Plant_Desc_010=The weaver palm was designed to produce a renewable, strong, lightweight, and flexible material that would serve a variety of purposes for settlers of a new world. Low maintenance and hardy, the plant can grow successfully in a variety of conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_011=The designers of this plant wanted to protect it from as many herbivore tactics as possible to ensure that its harvest could reach full maturity undisturbed while leaving it non-toxic. The spikes along the trunk makes climbing difficult, the bark appears diseased and dead, and the leaves contain barbed alkaloids that cause extreme pain with skin contact. DO NOT TOUCH.
NB_Plant_Desc_012=Designed to be grown in wet soil and marshland, the dracaena pura acts as a natural aquifer, cleaning water as it passes through its root system. The height of the plant helps it distribute the pollutants it collects to a lower toxicity level to which it can successfully cope.
NB_Plant_Desc_013=When worlds are first being settled, high winds can be a serious issue until enough plant life can take hold. The grand flabellum with its wide leaf structure and deep root system act as erosion breaks helping to protect more delicate plants and structures.
NB_Plant_Desc_014=The leaves of this plant were crafted by engineers to excrete an oil that serves as a natural insect repellent. It is hoped that by planting it in symbiosis with other more valuable crops that it can serve as a deterrent to harmful pests.
NB_Plant_Desc_015=Created to help alleviate symptoms caused by other airborne allergens, the pollen from the flight-of-fancy's bright flowers is a natural antihistamine and is capable of blocking histamine receptors. As a bonus, its large broad leaves provide ample shade making them ideal to plant near habitat areas.

Orison_DiscoverySpot_001_desc=To achieve the perfect level of atmospheric comfort, the vibrant city of Orison carefully maintains its precise orbital height above the gas giant Crusader through controlled firing of the Seraph-class thrusters situated below each platform. Precisely timed to prevent shearing and destabilization of the connected network of struts, each thruster is activated for a short burst allowing Orison to stay firmly in place. Crusader locals often describe the gentle vibrations that accompany the periodic adjustments as "Orison’s free massage." Be sure to hold on and enjoy!
Orison_DiscoverySpot_001_title=How Does Orison Stay in the Clouds?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_002_desc=Though it’s common knowledge that Crusader Industries works with the Navy on a handful of contracts, it’s less well known that Providence Platform was originally constructed as a Naval drydock in 2855 to take advantage of the lower gravity and breathable atmosphere found here. It was these same reasons that made the world such a great choice to be Crusader’s new headquarters. When the company purchased Stanton II in 2865, Providence Platform underwent major renovations to transform it into the cutting edge manufacturing center that it is today. Of course, while it may not be an official Navy site any longer, Crusader is proud to carry on the tradition of working to help people across the empire. 
Orison_DiscoverySpot_002_title=Was Providence Platform Built by the Navy?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_003_desc=While being a floating city may make for absolutely stunning vistas, it can be a bit tricky getting from platform to platform. No walking to work here! For Crusader employees and visitors alike the solution is Orison Skyway Shuttle Service. Providing connections to all major platforms, Crusader offers free and convenient transit shuttles made right here in Orison. These recently redesigned shuttles feature signature crystal canopies that provide amazing views of the city as you travel, helping to make getting there half the fun.

Orison_DiscoverySpot_004_desc=Cutting a stark contrast against the vibrant sky, the sweeping lines of Orison’s signature stormwal sculpture captures the grace and beauty of the gentle creatures it portrays. Formally titled "Until Again,"artist Bipasha Zhu says that she was inspired by the city’s harmony and weightless strength. To better understand her bashful subjects, Bipasha spent a week living in a cloud submersible studying the stormwals up close. Talk about taking your art to new depths! Art aficionados and visitors to Orison who want to get their own firsthand stormwal encounter should jump on board the next Orison Discovery Tour shuttle.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_004_title=What's the Story Behind Orison's Stormwal?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_005_desc=Orison is a city unlike any other and when it came to designing its gardens, only the perfect tree would do. Something that was well adapted to high winds and low humidity, that could self-pollinate, and most importantly, was beautiful. So which tree won? None of them. After a lot of searching, Crusader’s gardeners would have to create the perfect tree themselves. A cross-combination of flowering dogwoods and taverbark pines, the Hosanna tree features strong roots, flexible branches, delicately scented pink flowers, and the ability to make just about any walk in the park a memorable one. 
Orison_DiscoverySpot_005_title=Why are Orison's Trees so Special?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_006_desc=The name Crusader Industries actually has two meanings. First, it represents a commitment to stay on the forefront of ship manufacturing ideas. Though the company got its start building reliable planetary shuttles. The teams of engineers constantly looked to push the commercial ship market. Whether it was by developing a new feature of engineering or simply looking to fulfill a new area of public demand. Secondly, the name references the company's commitment to vigorously advocate for what is morally right across the Empire. Company founder August Dunlow has made giving back a cornerstone of the company ever since its inception in 2799. That means when you support Crusader Industries, you're supporting a company dedicated to improving the empire for all.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_006_title=What's the Meaning Behind Crusaders' Name?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_007_desc=More than just the name of a spaceport, Crusader Industries founder August Dunlow led a memorable and incredible life. Born on Angeli in the Croshaw system, he was orphaned in the aftermath of the bloody Khanos Stadium coup that ousted Imperator Messer X. Saved from the streets by a local charity, Dunlow was able to pursue his academics while volunteering in his spare time. Upon graduating from University of Angeli, he became a prominent anti-Messer activist and civil rights advocate pushing for government reform. August founded Crusader Industries in 2799 on the principle that a business truly thrives when it gives back to society. Today you stand among these majestic clouds thanks to his incredible vision that a company can be both financially profitable and a force for good.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_007_title=Who was August Dunlow?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_008_desc=Keeping Orison supplied and the shipyards stocked is an incredible operation in and of itself. On a normal day, over a quarter of a million SCU worth of cargo is moved between manufacturing platforms, shipyards, and support facilities with the help of Crusader’s Atlas-class cargo ferries. Specifically designed with an open top to expedite the loading and unloading of cargo, these barges run all day long and are the lifeblood of production on Orison. Over 5,000 Crusader employees focus solely on the logistics that keep the barges full and flying to their next drop point. This  beautiful ballet of people, ships, and cargo ensures that everything in Orison is running as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_008_title=Why does Orison have so many Transport Ships?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_009_desc=It takes a special kind of person to join the Crusader Industries family. Not only do employees have to be highly qualified and skilled, but most importantly, they have to be passionate about what they do. CEO Kelly Caplan always says "Crusader makes the best ships because we have the best employees"and it’s true! Just look at the 'Crusader Cares' charity initiative spearheaded by the generous workers here at Orison which has made a difference in the lives of people all over. Seems like they’re trying to make the rest of the empire as happy as they are!
Orison_DiscoverySpot_009_title=Who are the People Working for Crusader?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_010_desc=Believe it or not, building large spaceships is hard! If you attempted to build them in traditional factories on a planet with Earth-like gravity, you’d be faced with a massive amount of challenges just to  arrange the ship’s pieces into place and keep them from collapsing during construction. Sometimes these larger ships can’t even leave the atmosphere after they’re done which is why most larger ships are finished in space. But space has its own set of issues, sure, you don’t have to worry about weight, but all your engineers and mechanics have to work in spacesuits which is potentially more dangerous. On Crusader, our employees get the best of both techniques. Lower gravity and they can work in-atmosphere. No wonder people love working here!

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Hiding_High_IG_002=[PH] Come on out. Let's just talk this through.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Hiding_High_IG_003=[PH] No wonder you're still alive. You're a damn coward!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_High_IG_001=[PH] This ain't gonna end well for you!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_High_IG_002=[PH] I'll bet you wish you could go back and play this different.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_High_IG_003=[PH] You screwed with the wrong people.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_MissesTarget_High_IG_001=[PH] Got a whole clip here with your name on it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_MissesTarget_High_IG_002=[PH] Yeah, keep moving. Tire yourself out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_MissesTarget_High_IG_003=[PH] Dodge all you want. This ends with you dead!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_ShotsMiss_High_IG_001=[PH] You see that? You can't even hit me.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_ShotsMiss_High_IG_002=[PH] Did you just learn how to shoot that thing?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_ShotsMiss_High_IG_003=[PH] Gotta get you a better gun.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_AreaClear_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] We're clear.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_AreaClear_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Couldn't find anything out here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_AreaClear_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Nothing to worry about.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Deescalate_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] Knew it. It's nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Deescalate_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Huh, not a thing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Deescalate_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Didn't see a damn thing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] I knew there was something.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Someone else is around here, I swear.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] Better look again.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] There's some kind of issue here. I'll keep you updated.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Gonna keep searching.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Hey, I think I'm on to something. Get ready just in case.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] Forget it. False alarm.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Got all worked up over nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Well, that wasn't what I expected.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] It was a false alarm.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] All good. Forget about it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Hey, everyone can relax.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_InvestigateOrder_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] Find out what's there and report back.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_InvestigateOrder_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] This one's all you.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_InvestigateOrder_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] What? I got that last one.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] I'll give it a glance.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Looking into it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Let's see what's going on.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Investigating something unusual. It's probably nothing,
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Gonna check something out real quick.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Something's going on. Taking a look.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_KeepSearching_IG_001=[PH] They're around here somewhere. Keep at it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_KeepSearching_IG_002=[PH] No one stops looking until we find the bastard.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_KeepSearching_IG_003=[PH] We don't let anyone get away, understand?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IG_001=[PH] Who let them get away?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IG_002=[PH] Disgraceful, letting 'em get away like that.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IG_003=[PH] Letting 'em escape is unacceptable, damn it!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Don't know what to say, but they're gone.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] They got away, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone around here helped 'em.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] I agree. Them escaping is not ideal, but I don't know what the hell else to do about it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Whatever it was its gone now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Shit, I swear they were right here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] That's impossible... nothing's there.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Hey, nothing's there.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Yeah, strangest thing, I can't find anything.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] The investigation didn't turn up anything.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Someone's gonna to pay for dropping this body.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Get those guns locked and loaded. Whoever did this is probably still here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] Start searching. Can't let whoever did this get away.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Got a ghost. Starting a sweep to find the bastard responsible.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Came across a body. Gonna investigate the area.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Someone got dropped. Gonna look around and get to the bottom.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IG_001=[PH] Don't let the bastard escape. Find 'em.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IG_002=[PH] Shit, wherever they are, they won't get away long.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IG_003=[PH] Damn, they're gone. Let's find 'em.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Bastards slipped our surveillance, but I'll find 'em.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] The're gone, probably not far. I'll keep looking.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Yeah, they're either gone or hiding real good. I'll do another sweep.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IG_001=[PH] Find 'em! Kill 'em!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IG_002=[PH] Move out, find 'em!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IG_003=[PH] Let's get the jump on 'em!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Moving out to investigate.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Yeah, I'll get to the bottom of it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] If something's here, I'm gonna find it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Better check that out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Let's go to work.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] That's worth checking out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Heads up. Taking a walk around. Think we might have an audience.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Maybe got something. Kicking off a patrol to look into it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Something's up. I'll get to the bottom of it and let you know.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Lost_High_IG_001=[PH] Hide all you want. It's better this way. More fun.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Lost_High_IG_002=[PH] Go on, keep hiding. The hunt's my favorite part.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Lost_High_IG_003=[PH] I'll spend all day hunting you down if I have to.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Searching_Low_IG_001=[PH] The harder I have to look for you the angrier I get.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Searching_Low_IG_002=[PH] Just come on out, and we can keep this from becoming a bigger deal than it is.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Searching_Low_IG_003=[PH] Come on. Come on out. No one needs to get hurt here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeBulletImpactsClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Taking fire!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeBulletImpactsClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Shit, that was close.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeBulletImpactsClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Some bastard's after me!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Found a frickin' body.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Wonder what this one did wrong.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] Who killed 'em? Was this one of you?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeFriendlyTakenDown_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Someone got knocked!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeFriendlyTakenDown_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Taking injuries!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeFriendlyTakenDown_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] We're gettin' hit!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGrenadeIncoming_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] That's a damn grenade!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGrenadeIncoming_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Incoming! Look out!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGrenadeIncoming_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Grenade, shit!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGunfireClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Shots fired!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGunfireClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Shit! Those shots are close.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGunfireClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Who the hell's shooting?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeRocketLauncher_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Hit the floor!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeRocketLauncher_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Down, down, rocket!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeRocketLauncher_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Rocket coming this way.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSniper_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Sniper shots!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSniper_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Someone's headhunting!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSniper_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Sniper!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingAgain_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] Seriously, what's going on?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingAgain_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Come on, again?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingAgain_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Someone better not be messing with me.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Agree_IG_001=[PH] Something's not right.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Agree_IG_002=[PH] The hell? Any idea what that was?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Agree_IG_003=[PH] I don't like this one damn bit.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Ignore_IG_000=[PH] Quit bugging me over nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Ignore_IG_002=[PH] Stop messing around and stay focused.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Ignore_IG_003=[PH] You're in your head. Nothing's there.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Someone wants to tussle.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Bring it!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Today just got interesting.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatLow_Low_IG_001=[PH] What is that?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatLow_Low_IG_002=[PH] Hello?

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatMed_High_IG_001=[PH] Okay. That's not good.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatMed_High_IG_002=[PH] The hell!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatMed_High_IG_003=[PH] Don't like this one damn bit.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Agree_IG_001=[PH] Definitely heard something.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Agree_IG_002=[PH] Yeah, I heard it too.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Agree_IG_003=[PH] Yeah. What was that?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Ignore_IG_001=[PH] Settle down. I didn't hear shit.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Ignore_IG_002=[PH] Damn you're paranoid.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Ignore_IG_003=[PH] You better not be high again.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSound_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] You hear that noise?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSound_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Did you hear something?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSound_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Swear I heard something.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Agree_IG_001=[PH] Saw that too.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Agree_IG_002=[PH] What'd you see? I couldn't make it out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Agree_IG_003=[PH] Spotted it too.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_001=[PH] What you going on about?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_002=[PH] I didn't see shit.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_003=[PH] Don't get all worked up over nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisual_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] I just saw something.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisual_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Think i spotted something over there.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW2_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisual_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Did you see that?

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_AmmoDeny_IG_003=[PH] I'm running low myself.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_High_IG_003=[PH] Don't give 'em any mercy.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_Intruder_High_IG_001=[PH] We're compromised!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_Intruder_High_IG_002=[PH] Got intruders!

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_UpdateKnownPosition_EnemyRight_High_IG_001=[PH] Eyes right.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_UpdateKnownPosition_EnemyRight_High_IG_002=[PH] Enemy right.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericHeavy_High_IG_001=[PH] Heavy weapon!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericHeavy_High_IG_002=[PH] Eyes on a big ass gun.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericHeavy_High_IG_003=[PH] I don't know what kind of gun that is but it's big.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericShip_High_IG_001=[PH] Oh come on, really?!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericShip_High_IG_002=[PH] Enemy ship!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericShip_High_IG_003=[PH] Enemy ship inbound!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericVehicle_High_IG_001=[PH] They have vehicle support.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericVehicle_High_IG_002=[PH] Incoming vehicle!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_GenericVehicle_High_IG_003=[PH] Look out, they got a ride.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_RocketLauncher_High_IG_001=[PH] I think they got a rocket launcher.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_RocketLauncher_High_IG_002=[PH] Yeah, that's a rocket launcher!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_RocketLauncher_High_IG_003=[PH] Is that a -- rocket launcher!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_Sniper_High_IG_001=[PH] Sniper!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_Sniper_High_IG_002=[PH] They got a sharpshooter.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_Sniper_High_IG_003=[PH] Careful, there's a sniper.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_Titan_High_IG_002=[PH] Sweet mercy, they got a titan!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_EngageEnemy_WeaponType_Titan_High_IG_003=[PH] That seems unnecessary.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Fallback_High_IG_001=[PH] Let's step back a bit. You know, reassess.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Fallback_High_IG_002=[PH] Let's fall back.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Fallback_High_IG_003=[PH] Fall back! Fall back!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_FlankThem_High_IG_001=[PH] Circle their flanks!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_FlankThem_High_IG_002=[PH] We should hit them on the sides.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_FlankThem_High_IG_003=[PH] Let's sneak around and attack the flank.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_FollowMe_High_IG_001=[PH] Quick, follow me!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_FollowMe_High_IG_002=[PH] Let's go.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GetHits_FriendlyFire_High_IG_002=[PH] What are you doing?!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GetHits_FriendlyFire_High_IG_003=[PH] Have you gone blind?!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GetHits_ImHit_High_IG_001=[PH] Oh shit! I'm hit!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GetHits_ImHit_High_IG_002=[PH] They got me. They really got me!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GetHits_ImHit_High_IG_003=[PH] Ow! Dammit that hurts!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GrenadeIncoming_High_IG_001=[PH] Grenade!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GrenadeIncoming_High_IG_002=[PH] Everybody down!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GrenadeIncoming_High_IG_003=[PH] Get out of the way!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GrenadeThrowing_High_IG_001=[PH] And here we go!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GrenadeThrowing_High_IG_002=[PH] Let's see how they like this!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_GrenadeThrowing_High_IG_003=[PH] Might want to stay down for this!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealDeny_IG_001=[PH] I can't. Put pressure on it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealDeny_IG_002=[PH] I don't think I have any.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealDeny_IG_003=[PH] Yeah, I'm all out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealProvide_IG_001=[PH] Be healed!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealProvide_IG_002=[PH] Here you go!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealProvide_IG_003=[PH] Take this!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealRequest_High_IG_001=[PH] I need some meds!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealRequest_High_IG_002=[PH] Anyone spare a medpen?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealRequest_High_IG_003=[PH] Someone! Anyone! I need a heal.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_HealThanks_IG_001=[PH] Thank you, thank you.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_KeepFighting_High_IG_003=[PH] Let's go, let's go! They don't stand a chance.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastManStanding_Cocky_High_IG_001=[PH] You think I'm scared? You just killed the dead weight.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastManStanding_Cocky_High_IG_002=[PH] This is far from over.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastManStanding_Cocky_High_IG_003=[PH] That's it? I'm just getting started.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastManStanding_Panic_IG_001=[PH] This is fine. Everything's fine.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastManStanding_Panic_IG_002=[PH] Okay. Getting a little worried now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastManStanding_Panic_IG_003=[PH] This is not good.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastOfThem_IG_001=[PH] That wasn't so bad was it?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastOfThem_IG_002=[PH] There we go. Problem sorted.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_LastOfThem_IG_003=[PH] I think that was all of them.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_NoticeNotLastKnown_IG_001=[PH] They fuckin' vanished.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_NoticeNotLastKnown_IG_002=[PH] Where the hell are they?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_NoticeNotLastKnown_IG_003=[PH] They're gone.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_OutOfAmmo_High_IG_001=[PH] I'm out!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_OutOfAmmo_High_IG_002=[PH] Weapon's dry!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_OutOfAmmo_High_IG_003=[PH] Dammit, my ammo's gone
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Overheating_High_IG_001=[PH] Hold on. I think I shot too much.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Overheating_High_IG_002=[PH] Dammit, what is wrong with this thing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Overheating_High_IG_003=[PH] Ow. Hot, hot hot!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsArrive_High_IG_001=[PH] They actually showed up.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsArrive_High_IG_002=[PH] Hey, our backup arrived.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsArrive_High_IG_003=[PH] Those look like allies!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsInRoute_High_IG_001=[PH] Call's in. Help's on the way.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsInRoute_High_IG_002=[PH] Alright. Let's see if they show up.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsInRoute_High_IG_003=[PH] They said they'd send people.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsRequest_IntoComms_High_IG_001=[PH] Hey, I need some reinforcements.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsRequest_IntoComms_High_IG_002=[PH] Send backup. Sooner would be better.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_ReinforcementsRequest_IntoComms_High_IG_003=[PH] Hey, send some help. Now.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Reloading_High_IG_003=[PH] Give me a sec.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Retreat_High_IG_001=[PH] Let's get the hell out of here!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Retreat_High_IG_002=[PH] Are you insane? Run!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Retreat_High_IG_003=[PH] Screw this. I'm out!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_SpreadOut_High_IG_001=[PH] Maybe we should spread out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_SpreadOut_High_IG_002=[PH] We should cover some more ground.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_SpreadOut_High_IG_003=[PH] Let's fan out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_StayClose_High_IG_001=[PH] Keep close.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_StayClose_High_IG_002=[PH] I don't think you should wander.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_StayClose_High_IG_003=[PH] We should stick together.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Anger_High_IG_001=[PH] You little insignificant pissant! I'm gonna ruin you!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Anger_High_IG_002=[PH] I'm gonna bring an epic amout of hurt down on you!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Anger_High_IG_003=[PH] You're really starting to piss me off.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Hiding_High_IG_001=[PH] Seriously? Hiding? You're just being difficult now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Hiding_High_IG_002=[PH] How bout I hide and you come find me?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_Hiding_High_IG_003=[PH] Where you hiding now?!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_High_IG_001=[PH] Can you beileve today's the day you die?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_High_IG_002=[PH] Try not to get shot in anything valuable!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_High_IG_003=[PH] This fight is giving me some serious deja vu right now!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_MissesTarget_High_IG_001=[PH] Why won't you die?!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_MissesTarget_High_IG_002=[PH] How lucky can you be?!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_MissesTarget_High_IG_003=[PH] Come on! That one should've hit!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_ShotsMiss_High_IG_001=[PH] Can't wait till I tell my friends I met the worst shot in the 'verse!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_ShotsMiss_High_IG_002=[PH] Do you want to call a time out so you can go practice?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Combat_Taunt_ShotsMiss_High_IG_003=[PH] Bet you're having second thoughts now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_AreaClear_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] So, didn't find anything.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_AreaClear_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Everything looks like it should.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_AreaClear_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Area seems clear.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Deescalate_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] Huh... okay...
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Deescalate_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Bit anticlimactic.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Deescalate_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Feel a bit silly coming over here for nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Here we go. Got something. Keep looking.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Someone's definitely here. Just need to find them.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] On the right track.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Found something. Gonna keep looking.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Might be on to something. Let you know.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_EscalateSearch_NowThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Someone's here. Don't know who... yet.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] False alarm, everyone.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Forget it. Not gonna be a fight.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] Nevermind. Nothing exciting.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] False alarm. Go about your business.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Hey, you can tell everyone to calm down.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_FalseAlarm_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Nevermind. False alarm.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_InvestigateOrder_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] Why don't you go see what the hell it is?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_InvestigateOrder_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] How about you get off your ass and take a look.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_InvestigateOrder_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] If you're so concerned, go see what it is.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] Guess I'll go take look... I do everything around here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] Keep an eye out, I'm gonna see what the fuss is.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] All right. Let's see what we got.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Hey, might have something over here. Might not. I'll let you know.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Gonna take a look around.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Investigate_ThreatLow_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Something's a bit off. Gonna take a look.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_KeepSearching_IG_001=[PH] Keep searching. They've got to be close.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_KeepSearching_IG_002=[PH] Focus. They're here somewhere.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_KeepSearching_IG_003=[PH] Check everywhere. I want to find this asshole.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IG_001=[PH] Where the hell could they have gone?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IG_002=[PH] Did they fall into a jump point? Where the fuck did they go?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IG_003=[PH] What the hell? People don't just dissapear.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the bastard got away.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] No sign of them. They're in the wind.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_KnownThreat_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Hell if I know where they went. But they sure as hell ain't here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Well ain't that strange. All that smoke and no fire.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Really? Nothing?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] Okay, I give up. There's nothing here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Try as I might, didn't find anything.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Search turned up empty. Whatever was out here, I'm not seeing it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_SearchFail_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] I'm calling it. Nothing here.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Let's see if we can't say hello to the sicko who did this.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Gotta track down this killer before they can do it again.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] Bastard probably couldn't have gotten far.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Got a corpse I didn't kill. Looking for the responsible party now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Head's up. Someone's dropping bodies over here. We need to find the creeper fast.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearchCorpse_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Hey, hunting down some murderous skag. Will let you know if we find 'em.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IG_001=[PH] Well, isn't this an elusive prey.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IG_002=[PH] The bleeder shook me, but don't worry, I'll find them.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IG_003=[PH] Not sure where they went, but they couldn't have gone far.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] They pulled a runner on me. Gonna find them now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Tracking down where this slippery bugger went now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_NotLastKnown_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Where ever the hell this gunter went, I'm gonna find 'em.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IG_001=[PH] Duty calls.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IG_002=[PH] Think we got company.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IG_003=[PH] Come on. Let's get to work.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] We got visitors. Finding them now.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Guests have arrived. Gonna go greet them.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatHigh_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Seems like the party's starting. Come on. Don't want to be late.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] Let's see what the hell that was.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Well, that definitely wasn't nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] Good time to take a walk.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_001=[PH] Hey, I'm gonna stretch my legs and see if anything's going on.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_002=[PH] Get the feelin' like something's about to go down. Gonna take a look.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_StartSearch_ThreatMed_IntoComms_IG_003=[PH] Hey, checking something out. Hopefully it's nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Lost_High_IG_001=[PH] I don't appreciate you wasting my time!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Lost_High_IG_002=[PH] This is a lot of build up for me putting a bullet into your skull.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Lost_High_IG_003=[PH] Get out here! Or shoot me! Just do something already!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Searching_Low_IG_001=[PH] Hey, who's ever hiding out there, come out now and we can work something out. Promise. Won't even be mad.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Searching_Low_IG_002=[PH] Olly, olly, oxen free. Come out. Come out.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Hunting_Taunt_Searching_Low_IG_003=[PH] Where you hiding, you little bugger?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeBulletImpactsClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] They're shooting at me!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeBulletImpactsClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Under fire!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeBulletImpactsClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] I'm gettin' gunned!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_001=[PH] That's a bit of a mess.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_002=[PH] Great. A bloody corpse.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeCorpse_ThreatMed_IG_003=[PH] Who the hell ghosted this bastard?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeFriendlyTakenDown_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Ah geez! We're getting poached!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeFriendlyTakenDown_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Shit! We're under attack!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeFriendlyTakenDown_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Damn it! We're hit!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGrenadeIncoming_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Crap! Grenade!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGrenadeIncoming_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Grenade! Run!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGrenadeIncoming_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Grenade! Get back!

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGunfireClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Who the hell's shooting?!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeGunfireClose_ThreatHigh_High_IG_003=[PH] Looks like we got a party!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeRocketLauncher_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Crap! Rocket!
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeRocketLauncher_ThreatHigh_High_IG_002=[PH] Rocket! Down!

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingAgain_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] This again?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Agree_IG_001=[PH] Yeah, what was that?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Agree_IG_002=[PH] Definitely something.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Agree_IG_003=[PH] Damn well better not be someone hiding.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Ignore_IG_000=[PH] There's nothing there.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Ignore_IG_002=[PH] You having a laugh? Nothing's there.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomethingResponse_Ignore_IG_003=[PH] What you going on about?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatHigh_High_IG_001=[PH] Got a problem!

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatLow_Low_IG_002=[PH] Someone lurkin'?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatLow_Low_IG_003=[PH] Over there.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatMed_High_IG_002=[PH] Do I wanna know what that was?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSomething_ThreatMed_High_IG_003=[PH] That's not good.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Agree_IG_001=[PH] That noise? Yeah.

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Agree_IG_003=[PH] From over there. I heard it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Ignore_IG_001=[PH] Nope. Didn't hear a thing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Ignore_IG_002=[PH] Think your ears are playing tricks on you.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSoundResponse_Ignore_IG_003=[PH] How the hell should I know what you heard?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSound_ThreatLow_IG_001=[PH] I thought I heard something?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSound_ThreatLow_IG_002=[PH] What was that sound?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeSound_ThreatLow_IG_003=[PH] You hear that?

PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Agree_IG_002=[PH] Only caught a glimpse, but I'm sure I saw something.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Agree_IG_003=[PH] What the heck was that?
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_001=[PH] I didn't see nothing.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_002=[PH] I must've missed it.
PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_003=[PH] What? No.
