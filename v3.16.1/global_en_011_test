Journal_General_Healing_Content=Since its recent introduction, there’s no denying that regeneration technology has changed modern medicine for the better. Across the Empire, patients can now recover from injuries that would have been fatal in the past. However, as impressive as regeneration is, it is not a replacement for traditional care and treatments.\n\nBelow, we will outline a few important tips on regeneration along with some basic medical practices to help safeguard your health.\n\n--REGENERATION--\n\nRegeneration is the medical process in which a holistic bioscan known as an ‘imprint’ is used to recreate a near perfect copy of someone down to their memories. Because of the unique properties of the imprint, it maintains a remote connection to its source at all times and ensures that it can only regenerate someone after they experience a fatal event. \n\nThis connection, known as an ‘echo’, also means that traumatic experiences lower an Imprint’s Viability Score (IVS). Repeated regeneration may produce irregularities during the regeneration process and eventually render the imprint unusable.    \n\nTo create your very own imprint, visit a Tier 1 or Tier 2 medical facility and register on a kiosk. Once complete, that site will then be where you next regenerate. You can also store an imprint aboard a properly equipped vehicle. If the location or vehicle where your imprint is stored becomes unavailable, a back-up will always be available at your primary residence and you will regenerate there. Please note that having an active CrimeStat may have an impact on your regeneration site.\n\nHowever, because of the effect of imprint echoes on the regeneration process, it is important to remember that receiving first aid and medical treatment is always preferable to being regenerated.  The following breakdown outlines basic first aid to deal with a variety of injuries to help avoid needing to regenerate.\n\n--FIRST AID--\n\nThe first step when dealing with an injury is to identify how serious it is using a visor HUD, a self-evaluation (i.e. PIT), or if assisting someone else, a medical device. All injuries can be divided into three severity categories:\n\n- Minor injuries can be treated by Tier 3 (T3) medical facilities and are highlighted purple.\n\n- Moderate injuries can be treated Tier 2 (T2) medical facilities and are highlighted mauve.\n\n- Severe injuries can be treated by Tier 1 (T1) medical facilities and are highlighted pink.\n\nTo fully treat an injury, seek out an appropriately tiered facility at a rest stop, landing zone, or medically equipped vehicle. Attempting treatment at an incorrectly tiered facility can temporarily relieve symptoms, but the injury itself will remain. If you are alone and in need of transportation to a medical facility, you should contact a trusted acquaintance or use your mobiGlas to create a rescue service beacon.\n\nWhile injuries can only be treated at an appropriate medical facility, medication can be administered on site to temporarily alleviate associated symptoms. Before heading out a trip, it’s smart to bring along single dose pens, medical attachments, or full healing device with you.\n\nInjection pens are easy to carry and administer, but you will need to bring multiple pens to cover various symptoms and they can only be used once.\n\nSmaller medical attachments, like the LifeGuard for the Pyro Multi-Tool, allow for diagnostic scans and can administer a healing agent like Hemozal, but cannot treat other symptoms. They are typically used in conjunction with injection pens. \n\nFull medical devices like the ParaMed from CureLife provide detailed diagnostic scans and allows for the administration of multiple medicines along with full control of the dosage. However, it can be bulkier and more expensive than other options.\n\nFor ease of reference, here is an alphabetical list of common symptoms and the recommended medicines to relieve them.\n\n--COMMON SYMPTOMS--\n\n- Concussion – Caused by an impact to the head, individuals with a concussion will experience slower reaction times and have a harder time maintaining their balance. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine. \n\n- Health Loss – As displayed on your mobiGlas or bioscan, your ‘health’ is a simplified diagnostic number derived by combining information from several important monitored vitals. Sustaining injuries will cause you to lose health. Health can be restored by administering a healing agent like Hemozal.\n\n- Impaired Mobility – Caused by injuries to the limbs, torso or head, impaired mobility will make getting around difficult. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Incapacitation – Individuals who are incapacitated have had their health levels reduced to zero and will be unable to move. This is a potentially fatal condition and a healing agent like Hemozal must be applied must be applied in order to restore mobility. The amount of time until the condition is irreversible will be displayed on your mobiGlas. Note that factors like sustaining additional injures or having other confounding medical issues may impact how long you have. \n\n- Muscle Fatigue – Caused by injuries to the limbs, those suffering from muscle fatigue will move slower and have their refined motor skills affected. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine.  \n\n- Muscle Weakness – Caused by injuries to the arms, muscle weakness makes it difficult to do activities the require strength. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Ocular Inflammation – Caused by injuries to the head and results in vision obscured by inflamed blood vessels. Can be relieved by a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Partial Paralysis – Caused by injures to the limbs, partial paralysis makes it so the affected area is severely impaired resulting in the loss of the ability to do activities like running, climbing, and interacting with objects. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Respiratory Damage – Caused by injuries to the torso, this affects lung capacity and makes breathing or prolonged physical exertion very difficult. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Stunned – A temporary loss of consciousness that leaves the individual unable to move for the duration. Will relieve itself after enough time passes and consciousness is regained.\n\n--BLOOD DRUG LEVEL AND OVERDOSE RISK—\n\nWhile giving first aid is vital, know that it comes with its own risks. Administering medication will increase an individual’s Blood Drug Level (BDL) as will imbibing recreational drugs or alcohol. \n\nA high BDL can create a feeling of intoxication and may result in difficulty moving, blurred vision, and loss of refined motor skills. For your safety and other, it is strongly recommended that you avoid operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n\nOnce your BDL reaches a dangerous level it is called an overdose. Individuals experiencing an overdose will be stunned and will gradually lose health until they become incapacitated.\n\nFortunately, BDL will reduce naturally over time. Administering a detoxicant like Resurgera will speed the process and make it so you are no longer stunned. \n
