vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Medium Freight\n\nFreelancers are used as long haul merchant ships by major corporations, but they are just as frequently repurposed as dedicated exploration vessels by independent captains who want to operate on the fringes of the galaxy.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_Base=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Medium Freight \n\nFreelancers are used as long haul merchant ships by major corporations, but they are just as frequently re-purposed as dedicated exploration vessels by independent captains who want to operate on the fringes of the galaxy.

vehicle_DescMISC_Starfarer=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Heavy Refueling\n\nThe Starfarer differs from traditional bulk freighters in one key way: it is a dedicated fuel platform. The Starfarer is designed not only to load, store and protect fuel stasis units, it is designed to take in spaceborne hydrogen and then refine it for use without landing. The Starfarer can be used to ferry traditional bulk cargo pods (see diagram) but in such cases the fuel refining equipment would be useless. This equipment is modular and can be swapped out for another mission package for dry operations!
vehicle_DescMISC_Starfarer_Gemini=Manufacturer: MISC\nFocus: Heavy Refueling\n\nThe United Empire of Earth military uses an adapted ‘rough and tumble’ variant of the Starfarer for their front line operations. The G2M Gemini, more commonly the Starfarer Gemini or ‘Star G,’ trades some cargo capacity and maneuverability in exchange for reinforced armor, increased shielding, more powerful engines and stronger versions of the three manned turrets.
