manufacturer_DescXNAA=Though many attributed their elevation to the sole provider of light craft to audacity and daring, Aopoa cemented their position thanks to the innovative dual-vector thruster technology that has revolutionized their ship design.
manufacturer_DescYORM=Gotlieb Yorm was a top racing pilot on the professional circuit, who was known for his willingness to do anything to shave a few more seconds off his lap times. For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.

mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_001=A tremendous opportunity seems to have landed... well crashed in our favor. A Hurston satellite has quite ungracefully plummeted to the surface. Thankfully, it appears that a ~mission(Item) has miraculously survived the incident.\n\nNow, I know that there are plenty of Hurston's rivals who would be... eager... to get an advance look at this tech. I'm sure I could convince them to pay handsomely for an opportunity like this, but I'll need you to retrieve it. You can start your search at the ~mission(Location) and work out from there. \n\nOnce recovered, you will only have a short time to upload the information from the ~mission(Item) using the decryption software on a designated Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. Your best bet will be to access a data center inside one of the storage facilities that dot the surface of the planet. They typically have minimal security so I don't foresee you running into any issues. \n\nNeedless to say, I will pay you handsomely upon completion and we can both bask in knowledge that Hurston has been hit where it hurts.\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_002=I managed to intercept an interesting bit of news coming over the comms. It seems Hurston's fortunes are falling quite literally; one of their satellites has crashed to the surface. Not all is lost however, for the valuable ~mission(Item) onboard appears to have survived the impact.  \n\nNow, this is one of those moments where enterprising individuals face a choice. Either do nothing, let Hurston reclaim their property and let this wretched world keep turning or seize the opportunity to capitalize. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter and I'm hoping you feel the same. \n\nIf you were to obtain the part from the ~mission(location) before Hurston does, I'm sure I could find some parties interested in paying handsomely for a sneak peek at Hurston's hard work.\n\nOne catch (as always), is that in order to safely decrypt and extract the data, you must connect it to an official Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. I recommend using a storage facilities data terminal. They tend to be easier to access than anything that can be found in Lorville proper. Once the transfer is complete, I will issue your just rewards.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_003=My Dear Compatriot,\n\nWonderful tidings. It seems that we have received an unexpected but most welcomed guest - a Hurston satellite has been ejected from orbit and crashed practically straight into our laps. Most importantly, the ~mission(Item) onboard has survived intact.  \n\nNow, it just so happens that this cutting-edge Prototype has been long desired by some deep-pocketed associates of mine. If you were able to acquire this wayward Blade from the ~mission(Location) before Hurston manages to do so, I could ensure significant restitution for your time and troubles.\n\nThe only real wrinkle is that the information on the Prototype is inaccessible (and will self-destruct) unless connected to an official Hurston server. Fortunately, there is access to the said server dotted around the planet inside Hurston Storage Facilities. It should be short work for you to get the Blade and then take it to the server for decryption and extraction. Once the data transfer is finished, I will happily transfer the well-earned credits into your account. \n\nSafe travels,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)

mg_pacheco_assassin_law_desc_002=A BlacJac officer by the name of ~mission(TargetName) has put it in their mind that they’re going to be a hero and put a stop to our operation once and for all. \n\nProblem is that this shiner is smart and motivated enough to be an actual threat. \n\nWe need them stopped dead in their tracks before something sticks. And I don’t care how many BlacJacs you have to cut down to see it through.\n\n-Twitch\n
mg_pacheco_assassin_law_desc_003=~mission(TargetName), a long time BlacJac officer on our payroll, suddenly decided to grow a conscience and the new look doesn’t suit them at all. \n\nWe need ~mission(TargetName|Last) silenced before they have a chance to come clean.\n\nTake care of them and any BlacJacs that want to come along for the ride.\n\n-Twitch\n\n
mg_pacheco_assassin_law_desc_004=Don’t get me wrong, I love credits as much as the next person, but loyalty has a value beyond money. \n\nOfficer ~mission(TargetName) has decided that we aren’t paying them enough and is threatening to let their BlacJac bosses in on some of our business dealings.\n\nYou’re going to go put and end to this bastard’s greed once and for all. \n\nDon’t be surprised if they run crying to BlacJac for help once the shooting starts.

mg_pacheco_basesweep_law_desc_002=I have something big in the works but in order to pull it off I’m going to need to make sure that BlacJac won’t have enough resources available and that they’ll be suitably distracted. \n\nFigured I’d kill two birds and have you go raid ~mission(Location) and kill every officer you find there. \n\nThat should get their attention.\n\n-Twitch\n

mg_pacheco_prisonerbreak_desc_001=Here’s the deal - A couple of long timers got snagged pulling a job for me and I want you to spring them. \n\nA friendly mechanic has arranged for their prison transport to run into some trouble en route, venting the front door and bringing the ship to a halt.

This last bit is important. See, once they’re defrosted, they're gonna be sent off to retirement. No sense in them knowing any more about my business than they already do, i.e. I don’t want these lunks seeing your face or even knowing you exist. \n\nOnce you’re back on your way, I’ll send you a hefty pile of creds.\n\nNow just in case you’re getting any ideas along the lines of “Why don’t I just free everyone?” or “Wouldn’t it be easier to shut them all up permanently?” Forget it. The politics of this whole thing is more complicated than you need to know. Just understand that if any extra prisoners get freed or die without me ordering it, you’ll be the one who pays.

mg_pacheco_prisonerbreak_title_001=The Price of Freedom
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0001=Word is that security are gonna hit a stash house known as ~mission(Location) that some scabbers are using to store a treasure trove of narcotics. Among their supply, they've managed to snag a particular package of Maze. Seems like they're trying to up their station in the world.\n\nPrice of Maze on the street is skyrocketing... which is weird. Stuff just looks like wood chips to me. Anyway, I've gotten word that BlacJac's been tipped off to this little operation, so let's just say, this presents us with a unique opportunity. I know when the raid's going to start, so I want you to hit the stash before they show up and bring the Maze back. \n\nYou'll need a ship that can haul at least one box, but feel free to use something bigger. Anything else in the facility is up for grabs if you want to bother lifting it. Just be sure to deliver our Maze to ~mission(Destination) and we'll be square. Copy? \n\nIf you run into any resistance, I'll trust you'll deal with it, but the Maze is the real prize here.\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0002=Some of our competition over at ~mission(Location) is about to run into massive load of bad luck. BlacJac's caught wind of their stash house and are posting up to raid it.\n\nI've managed to find out exactly when they're going to hit the stash house, but I want you to hit it first. I imagine that the crew that's operating the stash won't be too enthusiastic about you robbing their supply, so if you run into any opposition, handle it.\n\nI want you to go in and steal their supply of Maze before security destroys it. Like I said, there's a bunch of drugs in there, but lucky for you Maze just looks like pieces of tree bark which should make it stand out. If you bring a ship that can hold enough cargo, you're welcome to help yourself to any of the other drugs in there. \n\nJust make sure that you can at least haul out the one box of Maze we're paying you for over to ~mission(Destination).\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0003=There's this little corner of heaven called ~mission(Location) that some of the local scumbags use to hand off drug shipments. You ever hear of it? \n\nWell, as of a few hours ago, a source told me that they were moving a package of Maze through there. I'm not sure if you've ever danced with that stuff before, but it looks like bits of bark.\n\nMy employers want it, but for whatever reason, they aren't willing to declare open war on this group. Apparently they're protected by somebody. Anyway, I tipped off BlacJac about the stash and they're getting ready to raid it. \n\nI want you to go in and secure the Maze before the place gets burned. Odds are this stash is gonna be guarded, so make sure you break some weapons. If you want to help yourself to anything else in there, that's on you to bring a ship big enough to haul it out. But at the very least bring a ship that can handle carting off the one box of Maze that's ours to ~mission(Destination). \n\nDon't worry about clearing out scavs you find there, either. Unless they get in your way that is. Thankfully, BlacJac'll get blamed for whatever body count gets left behind.\n\n-Twitch

They’re hoping to be able to start production again almost immediately and don’t want to bother with hiring new staff. Got that? Kill goons with guns, don’t kill workers.\n

You'll get paid once the site's clear.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_nocivs_desc_001=I know someone who’s looking to start up a new business, but they’re having a hard time hiring the skilled workers they need.\n\nNow the thing is, they found the perfect crew over at ~mission(Location|Address), but the people they work for won’t let them go.

mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0005=Long story short, ~mission(TargetName) screwed over the ~mission(Client) and as it turns out, it's going to be the last thing they ever do. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) A friend of the ~mission(Client) spotted them near ~mission(Location) so I'd suggest starting there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) You find them, you put them down.

Anything else you wanna grab is yours for the taking. ~mission(rush)I got all the details about ~mission(location), but once you get it, run it to my people over at ~mission(destination) and get paid. Should be squeezy. ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location).
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_obj_long_02=Get the ~mission(item) from ~mission(location)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_obj_long_03=Deliver ~mission(item) to ~mission(destination)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_obj_long_03a=Black Box
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_obj_short_01=Wreck Site

mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_timed_0001=This is rush job, okay? Can't waste time on this one. 
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_timed_0002=Need you to knock this out quick. They're paying for fast results. 
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_timed_0003=Understand that you'll be on a clock for this one. 
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_timed_0004=This is a priority gig, so no screwing around. Get it done fast. 
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_title=~mission(title)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_title_0001=box pull
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_title_0002=box runner

mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_title_0004=damn evidence
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0001=You might run into some trouble out there. I trust you know how to handle that. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0002=I'm not gonna lie. You may have to fight some people on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0003=Oh, one more thing. You might have to kill some people to pull this off. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0004=Hope you're up for a scrap. This job's set to get nasty. 
mg_ruto_commhack_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0001=Some ~mission(gang) are looking to get CommArray ~mission(CommArray) taken offline. ~mission(rush)Don't care how it's done. Just needs to get done. Sort it out for them and you'll get a nice bonus. ~mission(threat) ~mission(time)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0002=Look, no one likes being monitored while they work, right? So all we're going to do is take down Array ~mission(CommArray) for a little while while some people do some work. ~mission(rush)We don't need to get into who's doing what or any of the other details, the important thing is that once it's offline, some credits are going to find their way into your account courtesy of some ~mission(gang). ~mission(Time)Sounds good, right? ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0003=I just got paid to manufacture a blackout. Which means that you can get paid for executing one. It's fairly simple, head over to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. ~mission(time)~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0004=I was contacted by some ~mission(gang) to provide a little privacy. Guess they have a job or something going down. Anyway, that's not for you. You are going to bring down CommArray ~mission(CommArray). ~mission(time)~mission(rush)Take it down and I'll pay you out. ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0005=So it seems somebody wants to make an area less secure. Shocking, right? As a struggling businessman in these tough economic times, I am uncomfortable with such a request, but I feel obligated to my clients. Customer service is very important to me. Anyway, you'll need to gain entry to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. Just an FYI, the ~mission(gang) who are putting up the creds for this are VIP, so make sure it's done right. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_long_01=Go to CommArray ~mission(CommArray).
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_long_02=Disable uplink at CommArray ~mission(CommArray).
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_short_01=Hack Site
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_short_02=Disable Uplink
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0001=Get a move on, yeah? Need this done quick. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0002=Gonna need this handled on the quick side too, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0003=Don't mess around. This has got to get done now. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0004=You need to move quick on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0001=One more thing though, you're gonna need to make sure it stays off for a while. The pros need time to work, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0002=When it's done, I'm gonna need you to babysit the array. Make sure no do-gooders come and switch it back on. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0003=Here's the deal. Once the array's down, make sure it stays down. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0004=You'll need to stick around once the hack's done. I need that blackout sustained for a bit. 
mg_ruto_commhack_title=~mission(title) (~mission(CommArray))

mg_ruto_commhack_title_0007=Service Interrupt
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0001=You might run into a little trouble out there. I mean, that's fitting right? You are going out to find a body. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0002=And arm up. You're heading to a crime scene, you know. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0003=Keep an eye on your scans. There might be some unfriendly sorts out there. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0004=This might go without saying, you are hunting down a corpse after all, but there might be a bit of violence out on this job. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0001=A bit of backstory on this one. Some random scav has been going around claiming that they offed a big time hitter by the name of ~mission(TargetName). Claims that they caught ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) right in the middle of pulling a job. Now the thing is, if ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) is really dead... well... that creates complications for the ~mission(Client). \n\nAnyway, after some careful negotiations from yours truly, they've coughed up some creds to pay for someone to go out and verify that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is actually dead. ~mission(Timed)You will just need to go to ~mission(Location), find the body and confirm. ~mission(Danger) 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0002=Here's a bit of dreadful business to throw your way. ~mission(Client) had a recent op that apparently turned into a total shitshow. Mayhem and carnage to the nth degree. Anyway, the rumor was that ~mission(TargetName) got clipped in the exchange, but now people are saying that the bastard's still alive. \n\nAnyway, the ~mission(Client) need to know one way or the other. That's why I'm having you go out to ~mission(Location) and confirm that they're a corpsicle. Once you get the ID, you get paid. ~mission(Danger)Pretty simple, right? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0003=Everyone's been talking about ~mission(TargetName) recently. The ~mission(Client) have been saying that they were killed a few days ago in the middle of pulling a job for them, but... well, let's just say that they're a less than accurate source of information. Anyway, I've got a client who's eager to prove them wrong, so they're shelling out some creds to get a positive id on the body. I'll hook you up with the  ~mission(Location). You have a look and tell me if you find them. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0004=Got a simple, but kinda disgusting job here. In a recent raid, ~mission(TargetName)'s ticket got punched and I guess the ~mission(Client) want some proof of old ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s remains for... something. I honestly don't know why. Maybe they're worried that the bastard is playing dead just to steal from them. Anyway, they gave me the  ~mission(Location) and are paying for someone to go out and confirm the kill. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) hired a hitter to take out a rival who's been poaching on their turf, but between you and me, I guess they didn't really get their credits worth because the guy forgot to provide proof that ~mission(TargetName) was actually dead. Anyway, I told them I could provide that, and by that, I mean you could provide it. All you gotta do is go to  ~mission(Location) and confirm that ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s touching void. ~mission(Danger)Once I get confirmation, you get paid. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_location_0001=the ship's remains

mg_ruto_confirmkill_obj_long_02a=Confirm
mg_ruto_confirmkill_obj_short_01=Wreck Site
mg_ruto_confirmkill_obj_short_02=Locate Corpse
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0001=Do hurry up, will you? Body probably won't be there forever. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0002=Another thing, the clients would like to know now, so get to it. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0003=I don't really know how long bodies stick around for, so I'd recommend getting a move on. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0004=You might want to move fast. God knows what's happening to that body right now.

mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0001=Odds are, anyone you come across won't be too pleased to see you. I trust you'll be able to handle them. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0002=I'm not anticipating this to be a smooth run though, so I'd make sure your guns are working. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0003=I'm not gonna lie. This one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0004=Just gonna say, the last couple people I've sent on these runs have gotten tuned up, so stay sharpish. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0005=Might wanna get ready for a fight too. You never know. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0001=This one's gonna be a little tricky. The ~mission(Client) need someone to set up a ~mission(Item) so they can eavesdrop on the local suckers. You have to pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location), set the thing up at ~mission(Destination) and get out. ~mission(Danger)Once it's up and running, you'll get your creds.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0002=Need someone to set up a snooping device for the ~mission(Client) and they're gonna pay well to make it happen. First you'll need to pick up a ~mission(Item). I think they got one set aside over at ~mission(Location). Anyway, whenever you've got one, make your way over to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)You gotta set it up at the right spot or it won't work. Once the thing's running, get the hell out of there. Creds will be waiting when you're clear.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0003=~mission(Client) are paying for someone to drop a ~mission(Item) over at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)Pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location) and get to it.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0004=You ever work with a ~mission(Item)? It's fairly simple stuff. Take it to an area, turn the thing on, and it taps into nearby comms. Nice little system if you're looking to dig up a little intel, maybe scout out a couple marks to hit. Anyway, I need one dropped at ~mission(Destination) for this thing I'm looking into and I need you to set it up. ~mission(Danger)Head over to ~mission(Location) and pick it up, they got one set aside for you. I'll transfer the credits once you got it active.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0005=I guess the ~mission(Client) are cooking up something big. They've requested a ~mission(Item) get set up over at ~mission(Destination). You'll need to grab one from ~mission(Location), head over and set it up. They're pretty self-explanatory, so don't sweat the set up. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnyway, once you got the ~mission(Item) in place and active, get the hell out of there. I'll pay you after.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0006=Got client who's looking to put some ears on ~mission(Destination). All you gotta do is head over to ~mission(Location), pick up a ~mission(Item) then go set it up. ~mission(Danger)Job ain't over until the ~mission(Item)'s up and running, so make sure it's safe and operational. Once they get the data stream, you get the creds. Simple, right?
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_02=Collect the ~mission(Item).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_03=Go to ~mission(Destination) to deploy ~mission(Item).

mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_002=I want you to make people think you're the second coming of Ivar Messar or... you know, one of the bad ones. 
mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_003=By the time you're done, I want your name to be a warning. 
mg_ruto_distraction_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0001=I have to say, this might be one of the best plans I've ever come up with. See, the ~mission(client) are looking to pull off the job of the century, but no way they'd get away clean. That is of course, unless there's something even bigger going down at the same time. You're gonna be the something bigger. I'm talking chaos on a whole new scale. \n\n~mission(wanted)With that nasty of a reputation, all you have to do is go visit a ~mission(Location) in the area and shoot at everything that shows up. I'll even tip off the authorities so they know exactly where you are. I figure with all the noise you'll be making, no way anyone gives two shits about what the ~mission(client) are up to.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0002=This is the sort of job most scavers only dream about getting paid for. How often do you get paid to make as big of a mess as you can?\n\n~mission(wanted)Between the bounty on your head, and me telling everyone where to find you, you should have about every ship in the sector on your ass in seconds. I figure we'll have you make your stand at a ~mission(Location) and I'll make sure word gets out on where to find you. Then all you have to do is keep them occupied for as long as you can. \n\nOf course, you're probably wondering why you're doing all this. While I can't tell you the details, let's just say that the ~mission(client) are going to be very appreciative for you keeping all the security forces occupied.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) are gonna pay you to unleash as much hell as you can in the sector. ~mission(wanted)You show up at a ~mission(Location) guns blazing, I put the word out on the spec, and just like that, everybody is looking the other way while the real job is going down. Classic misdirection.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0004=You know how I normally want my people to keep a low profile? Well, not this time. The ~mission(client) need you to tie up every bit of law in the sector. Make them so busy they won't notice anything else going on. I'm talking next level destruction. ~mission(analogy)~mission(wanted)\n\nEven better is I'll tip off everyone before hand so they know exactly where to find you. I'm thinking a ~mission(Location) since those are usually patrolled to begin with. Then all that's left is for you to take down as many of the bastards as you can. Should make headlines on the spec for weeks.

mg_ruto_distraction_obj_long_01=Achieve a level five crimestat.
mg_ruto_distraction_obj_long_01a=Maintain a level five crimestat.

mg_ruto_distraction_title_0004=all eyes on you
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_001=To make sure that they're paying attention, you're gonna have to get yourself to crimestat 5 and stay there. Only way to guarantee that every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_002=Here's the real fun part. In order to pull this off, I need you to get a level 5 crimestat. Hack a comm array, kill a bunch of people. I don't really care how. Just get to level 5 and stay there. That way there's no chance they're gonna be able to ignore a dangerous criminal such as yourself. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_003=Now, the reason I wanted you for this job specifically is cause of your crimestat level. Only a level 5 like yourself is a big enough threat to pull the kind of heat I'm talking about. Just do me a favor and make sure you stay at a 5 till this is all over. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_004=Plus, with your crimestat at a 5, you're the ideal candidate to pull this job off. Everyone within the system will be beating each other senseless to get a crack at taking you down. It's perfect. As long as you stay a level 5 that is. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_005=In order for this to work, you're gonna need to have a crimestat 5. That's the only way to make sure every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. Now, as it happens, I'm plugged directly into the system's ECN, so once you take the gig, I'll make you notorious.
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_006=The catch is you gotta instantly become the system's most wanted to get the kinda heat we want all focused on you. Fortunately, I got myself a backdoor into your criminal files to make that happen. All you gotta do is say yes and your crimestat goes through the roof, then you just focus on raising some hell out there.

mg_ruto_havejob_title_0008=got something for you
mg_ruto_intromission_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0001=Hi there. I've been hearing your name pop up a lot recently on security channels. Seems you're pretty hell bent on making life difficult for those authority types. I'll be honest. I like that kind of initiative. I know some people who might be interested in subsidizing your anti-social habits. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI'd like to see how you operate in the field myself, so here's the deal, the ~mission(Client) have pushed someone into the sweet hereafter and have paid for someone to make the remains disappear. That's considerate, right? No sense letting trash like that stink up ~mission(Location01). Anyway, I'd like you to go there, collect the boxes and dispose of them. Don't really care where as long as it's off-world and not in front of some cops. Simple, right? Anyway, you do this and we can talk about further, more lucrative, employment opportunities. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0002=You're becoming quite popular among the unsavories. My name's Ruto. You've probably heard of me. I'm a sort of talent scout for unsavories myself and I'm pretty good at it, if I say so. Part of the reason for that is standards. Not a lot of people have 'em. Me, I need to know that when I give a job to one of my people, that they'll execute it. Otherwise, it's just chaos, you know? But the bad kind. \n\nAnyway, I think we might be able to help each other out. First though, I need to see you in action for myself. The ~mission(Client) ghosted some idiot down at ~mission(Location01) and need the packaged up remains disposed of. Feels like something you could handle, no? Knock this out and maybe we can talk more. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0003=Why hello. Been watching you for a while now. Not in a creepy way or anything, more like professional curiosity. See, I make it my business to know who's making moves in my system. If I see someone with potential, let's just say, I bring them into the fold. \n\nAnyway, I think you might be the kinda person I should know better. But first, I've got a little job for you. Something simple to show me that you're not one of these lazy kids I see on the spectrum. That you're a real go-getter. \n\nThere's remains of a body down at ~mission(Location01). I won't tell you who did it or why. Only that the boxes need to get gone. Take them off-world somewhere and dump it. You do that and maybe I can fill you in on all the exciting opportunities available to an entrepreneurial go-getter like yourself. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_02=Collect the body.
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_03=Get rid of the corpse off-world.
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_marker_01=Pickup Site
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_marker_02=Corpse
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_short_01=Go to pickup site
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_short_02=Collect body
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_short_03=Dump body
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0001=Need to take care of this quick though. Sorry. Hate to rush, but you know, clients are paying.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0002=Oh, I'll need you to sort this out on the quicker side.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0003=One more thing, you'll need to hurry. Clients want this handled now.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0004=Yeah, probably should mention that I need this taken care of immediately, so off you go.

mg_ruto_invite_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0001=You handled yourself pretty well. I suppose it's time we meet up and make this official. Sound good? I'm working out of this old tech shop on Grim HEX called Technotic. Just come on in and find me in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, swing by when you can.
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0002=Thanks for taking care of that little job for me. Hope it wasn't too messy. Anyway, as promised, I'd like to invite you down and see if we can't work out a little arrangement. If you're interested, head on over to Grim HEX. Somewhere in the back halls, you'll find a run down little hole called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0003=I think it's about time we talked about your future. Don't you think? You ever been to Grim HEX before? Nasty little corner of nothing in the field above Yela. Swing on by and look for a tech shop called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, we'll have a little chat about your future, yeah? See if we can help each other out.
mg_ruto_invite_obj_long_01=Meet with Ruto in Grim HEX
mg_ruto_invite_obj_marker_01=Ruto
mg_ruto_invite_obj_short_01=Meet with Ruto
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_001=Don't mind the guy at the front. He's kinda like a watch dog. Just older... and quieter.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_002=Whatever you do. Don't piss off the guy at the front. He may not look like much, but he's an ex-Marine.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_003=Word of warning, the guy I have guarding the counter is violent. Real violent. If you see him wearing green, run. That's his trigger color.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_004=Make sure the guy in the front doesn't talk your ear off.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_005=Don't worry about the antique at the front counter. He came with the place.

mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0001=The longer they're dark, the more credits we lose. Need them up and running ASAP. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0002=A lot of people are waiting on them to be up and running again, so basically, hurry the hell up with this. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0003=A lot of credits run through the place which makes this repair pretty damn urgent. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0004=Some other jobs I got cooking are waiting on this being taken care of and I don't like being kept waiting. Faster you get this done the better. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0005=Not to rush you or anything, but this needs to get taken care of fast. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0001=Normally people in our rarified profession don't mind working in the shadows, but having zero power is a bit much. It's even starting to hurt the operations down over at ~mission(Destination). See if you can go sort them out with a new battery, okay? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0002=A storm down surface side a little while back caused some damage and now ~mission(Destination) doesn't have any power at all. Can't really afford to have them down for long, so I need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0003=Some wingnut over at ~mission(Destination) tried fixing an electrical problem on their own and now the whole outpost doesn't have power. Got to love that DIY attitude. I'm having flashbacks to ~mission(DIY). ~mission(Timed)Anyway, do me a favor and run a battery down there.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0004=I'm hoping you have some maintenance experience, because I need someone to bring a replacement battery down to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)And if anyone's there when you show up, don't let them talk you into cleaning up or anything. The contract is just for the battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0005=Got word from ~mission(Destination) that they've gone dark. Not sure what the hell they're doing there, but this is like the fifth time they've lost power this month. Probably trying to run a hot tub or something off the gennie. Either way, gonna need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_01=Acquire replacement battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_02=Go to ~mission(Location).

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0001=There was an 'accident' and now there's a couple of boxes of remains where they shouldn't be. ~mission(Client) need a cleaner to cart them off-world. ~mission(Timed)And don't tell me what you do with them. It's probably better if I don't know.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0002=The ~mission(Client) had a change of leadership and their former manager's been made redundant right through the eyes. Now they need someone to "clear out the desk," so to speak, and dump everything off-world. ~mission(Timed)Really makes me appreciate being self-employed.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0003=Bit of a going away party / funeral that I want you to attend. The guest of honor needs a ride off-world and you're gonna give it to 'em. Dead bastard really should have known better than to skim from the ~mission(Client). ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0004=Guess there was a bit of a disagreement between a couple of ~mission(Client) that got pretty heated. Anyway, they need someone to escort whatever's left of the losing side off the premises. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0005=One of the big truths in this 'verse is that dead bodies seldom go anywhere on their own. That's why the ~mission(Client) need us to move one for them. I'm sure you can figure out somewhere suitably private to take the remains. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address).

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0002=The ~mission(Client) are a little on edge about the remains just sitting out there. I've told them there's nothing to worry about, but let's go ahead and take care of this as fast as possible. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0003=We need to hurry up and take care of this before before someone starts poking around. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0004=Gonna call this a rush job. Remain are not going anywhere, but the ~mission(Client) will feel a lot better once everything's been taken care of. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0005=Don't take too long on this. Last thing we need is for someone else to get to the remains before you do.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0001=This is a simple delivery run. Pick up a box of ~mission(drug) from ~mission(location) and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0002=Short and sweet. You're gonna head to~mission(location) and pick up a shipment of ~mission(drug). Make sure you keep a low profile and run it to ~mission(destination)". Simple. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)One more thing. This is for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0003=Word's come down that the ~mission(client) need some product moved from ~mission(location) and delivered to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Hopefully I don't need to reiterate this, but don't even think about sampling the supply.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0004=Apparently there's been a high demand for ~mission(drug), so the ~mission(client) need to re-up their dealers. You're gonna head down to ~mission(location), pick up the package and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0005=Here you go. Like I said, it's a pretty straightforward job. ~mission(client) need some ~mission(drug) grabbed from ~mission(location) and taken to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)You do this right and not only will you stay in my good graces, you'll make some nice creds as well. Seems fair, right? ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0001=This job comes with a timetable, so I'm gonna need you to move quick on this. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0002=Hurry up too. I'm told the masses are eager for their party favors. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0003=You'll be on a clock with this one. The~mission(client) need their supply quick.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0002=A little bird told me that there might be some heavies out gunning for this job too. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0003=You might need to fight some people on this one. Just so you know. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0004=Be ready for a scrap. I'm not expecting this one to go smoothly. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0001=Make sure you bring some guns. There's a high potentiality that this one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0002=There's a good chance you might need to kill some people on this one. I trust you don't have a problem with that. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0003=And keep your eyes open. Word is there are predators circling, if you get my meaning. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0004=You don't mind killing people right? I'm not promising anything, but you might want to make sure you got some guns. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0005=Guy I know said that this job might've been shopped around before it landed with me, so there might be some unfriendly competition out there. Handle them. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0001=~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) transported from ~mission(location) and dropped at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0002=You know how to move a box, right? This is right up your alley then. Pick up a ~mission(item) at ~mission(location) and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)Get it done right and the ~mission(client) cut you some creds. Simple. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0003=We've been hired by the ~mission(client) to move some cargo. Now, they didn't tell me what's in the box and you're going to be paid not to care. All you gotta do is snag the ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) and get it to ~mission(destination) in one piece. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat) \n\nOh, do me a favor and don't look inside, okay? 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0004=As far as gigs go, they don't get much more basic than this. All you gotta do is go to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item). Once you got it, take it over to ~mission(destination) and dump it. That's it. Seriously. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0005=This is a a straight cargo run. The ~mission(item) needs to get from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)This is a job for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0006=Got a simple run for you. Well... it should be pretty simple. ~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) moved from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)Get the ~mission(item) there in one piece and you get paid.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_rush_0003=Hurry up on this one. There are people waiting. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_rush_0004=If you do this job, make sure you take care of it quick.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0001=Here's the deal. Some people I know have some ~mission(Item) that needs disposing of. I know. I know. Not exactly the type of work you dreamed of doing, but creds are creds, right? Times like these, people should be grateful for anything that comes their way. All you gotta do is pick up the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. Don't care where, but maybe not in front of some cops.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0002=Kind of a basic run. Not really worth your talents, but hey, a gig's a gig, right? All you gotta do is pick up some ~mission(Item) and get rid of it. That's it.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0003=Need you to swing by one of my clients and take away some ~mission(Item). They're paying to get it off-site and off-world, but don't care what happens after that, so neither do I. Do it and you'll get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0004=Looks like a friend needs some ~mission(Item) disposed of without any questions. Head there, grab the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. They don't come much simpler.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0005=Hope you don't mind getting your hands dirty. I'm serious. This isn't a metaphor. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to get dumped. Head on over and they should have it all boxed up and waiting for you to get off-world. One time contract. Standard pay.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0006=This here's a quick one. Shouldn't be too much trouble. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to disappear. Pick it up, dump it off, get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address).

mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_001=And I don't know if they've been doing some special training, or if they changed what they've been feeding the bastards, but some of these security pilots aren't half bad at fighting. Make sure you go in ready. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_002=Now, if this was a one on one, I'd put my credits on you hands down, but since these sec-jobs tend to travel in packs, clearing them out may end up being a pretty tough fight. Not trying to scare you off, just think you should know what you're in for. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_003=Be good to teach these corporate guns that standing up to the ~mission(client) doesn't pay. However hard they fight - and trust me, they're gonna fight - you fight back even harder. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_004=Of course, as much as we make fun of these security hacks, don't underestimate them. Any idiot with a gun can kill you if you get sloppy. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0001=~mission(contractor) have gone ahead and started poking around somewhere they shouldn't. You're gonna make them stop. Head out to ~mission(location) and clear every last one of those advocacy-wannabes from along their patrol route. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0002=Seems ~mission(contractor) has started patrolling out over in ~mission(location) by some of the ~mission(client)' territory. They'd normally take care of it themselves but since they've got something bigger in the works that they'd rather not risk, decided to hire an outsider to sweep the area clear. ~mission(danger)Last thing, try not to let any of them escape. It's not really professional, you know?
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) have a score all lined up, but they can't do anything about because some over-achieving ~mission(contractor) lugs are patrolling ~mission(location). Need you to fly along the route and take out any security you find. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0004=I tried to warn them, but the ~mission(client) got overeager and now, thanks to them attacking too many civies, ~mission(contractor)'s stepping up patrols through ~mission(location). Gotten so bad they can't do business as long as security's there. That's where we come in. You're going to fly the patrol route and sweep it clean. ~mission(danger)Honestly though, I think you're gonna have a lot of fun with this one.
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0005=Despite the best efforts of myself and the other criminally-minded individuals in this sector, ~mission(contractor) is still trying to clean the place up. They even started patrolling out in ~mission(location). Can you believe it? There's no way we're gonna let that kind of initiative stand, so that's why you're going to fly along this patrol and clear them the hell out. ~mission(danger)

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0002=Anyone messes with you, you drop them, yeah? 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0003=Another thing, this'll take you in some rough parts of space. I'd recommend guns. Lots of guns. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0004=You know, looking at the ~mission(ship)'s position, I'm thinking you might wanna make sure your guns are all charged up. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0005=One of my people told me the ~mission(client) might've shopped this job around, so you may run into some trouble.

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0002=I'll keep this simple. I need you to extract a ~mission(item) from the corpse of a ~mission(ship) and leave it at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)The ~mission(client) passed along the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0003=~mission(client) are hiring. They want someone to head out to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item) from the wreck. I don't know if they killed the ~mission(ship) and I don't really care. Once you got the ~mission(item), just take it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0004=This is that gig I was telling you about. Seems pretty casual, if you ask me, but I don't have to go out there. Anyway, ~mission(client) want someone to pull a ~mission(item) from a ~mission(ship) corpse and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0005=I know how much love crawling around the wreckage of a ~mission(ship) so I saved this one just for you. And guess what, the ~mission(client) will even pay you for it. All you gotta do is snag a ~mission(item) while you're out there and take it to ~mission(destination). I'll send you the details on ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0006=I'm gonna include the exact job request from the ~mission(client) in its entirety just so you can see what I have to deal with:\n\nhy Ruta, my offaz an i went an downed a ~mission(ship) off in the black. bozz wanna boxes from it but didnt tell us. we three bottlz inna night and needin someone to go grab it. i sendin creds for it. \n\nI just don't know how some of these idiots stay alive as long as they do, much less fly a spaceship.

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc=~mission(Contractor|StealDescription)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0001=Here's the deal, got a tip from ~mission(Contractor|StealNickname) that some skag named ~mission(TargetName) got real ambitious and snagged a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from some suckers. That's all well and good, but it seems that they owe some creds to the ~mission(client) and have been refusing to use their newfound wealth to settle up. Now, the ~mission(client) want someone to ghost 'em and retrieve the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreck. That way, they get their money back and remind any future idiots that they gotta pay their debts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) Once you get the goods, drop them off at ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0002=How do you feel about thieving from thieves? Shouldn't matter, right? The ~mission(client) are looking to hire someone to obtain ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from some geezer's ship. Find them, hit them, grab the stuff and drop it at ~mission(destination). That'll be that. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0003=Here's that robbery I was telling you about. Need you to hit some poor bastard named ~mission(TargetName) who's made the massive mistake of acquiring some ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that the ~mission(client) are looking to obtain. ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger) Once you got it, run it over to ~mission(destination) and I'll make sure your credits are waiting. After my cut, of course. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0004=How're your boosting skills these days? Job's fairly simple. Track down a ship owned by ~mission(TargetName), take it out and retrieve a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreckage. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) Once you got it, all you gotta do is drop off the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) over at ~mission(destination). Pay's coming down from ~mission(client), so make sure you deliver.
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0005=~mission(client) are paying for someone to knock over ~mission(TargetName)'s ship and steal a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem). Contract's very specific that they got to go. No bargains, no mercy, just one to the dome and a trip to their cargo hold. Take the stuff to ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0006=Friend of mine said that ~mission(nickname) was posted up in Old38 wasted out of their mind, bragging about how ~mission(TargetName) had scored a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that was, and I quote, 'valuable as hell.' Now, I floated this tidbit out to the sharks and the ~mission(client) were the most interested. They're willing to pay for you to head out, track down ~mission(TargetName|Last)'s ship and snatch the loot. Once you do, run it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(client) will transfer the creds once they get it. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger) I think we've all learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of bragging, haven't we?

Unfortunately, since it's connected to our criminal database, local thugs have been using it to erase their criminal records. I've gotten approval to contract independent operators as temporary security personnel to guard these terminals against unauthorized access. If you subdue any trespassers, we will provide additional compensation as hazard pay.\n\nIf you accept this position, we will provide you with the equipment to complete your job. Please understand that you will have to stay on-site for the duration of your shift. Should an emergency arise before your shift is over, you just need to resign your post at the security office before leaving. Unauthorized departure will be considered a breach of contract and result in criminal charges.\n\nSincerely,\nPauline Nesso, Facilities Manager\nSecurity Post Kareah, Crusader Industries

There are a few places around the system where you could access one, but Crusader’s latest construction project, Security Post Kareah, ran into a few ‘problems’ that left it unstaffed, but still connected. Perfect place to sort yourself. First, grab a cryptokey (Technotics in Grim HEX might be able to set you up), then go hack the access terminal, and just like that, no more crimestat ratings.\n  \nBut hey, maybe you like getting hassled by those idiots.\n\n-Ruto

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_01_Text=LAST UPDATED: 2945-03-21_16:44SET\n\nOn 2945-03-03 we received our first report of missing BIG BENNY brand vending machines from the Port Olisar commuter hub station. Alby Mollion, the on call manager, explained that a TERRA MILLS SERVICE TECHNICIAN had come to repair the machine and informed him that it would have to be taken to an offsite center. The following week, shift supervisor Tony Losong contacted Terra Mills Service Center to inquire about the repair only to learn that the so-called service technician had not in fact been associated with the company. It was at this point that Crusader Security was contacted by the Port Olisar administrators to look into the matter. Security vids pulled from the station’s feed captured the suspect leaving with the machine in question but so far, facial match has been a dead end. It is surmised that the suspect was wearing spoofs, faux-vis, or some combination thereof. Attempts to track the suspect’s transport also proved futile as the regtags were traced back to a decommissioned hauler. \n\nOn 2945-03-05, we received a second report from CryAstro station 1267SC where their Big Benny unit was also taken under the guise of repair. Not long after, dozens of similar reports from other stations around the Crusader sector began to trickle in, stating that a false Terra Mills technician had removed their Big Benny machines. Those separate reports were vetted and indexed under this main casefile once the connection was confirmed. \n\nIn the meanwhile, we have been working with Terra Mills to issue a general warning to all Big Benny machine owners to be on the lookout for unscheduled service technicians and that they should always demand to see credentials. An image of the suspect has likewise been circulated. However, since 2945-03-12 there have been no further reports.\nIn attempt to track down the culprit we have notified scrap yards and secondhand sellers to alert us if someone tries to offer a Big Benny unit for sale. We have also tasked Terra Mills with tracing unusual refill orders surmising that the stolen machines may eventually require more Kacho to be stocked. \n\n**EDIT 2945-03-21 ** We did have a possible hit on the VSS we put out on the suspect’s transport, but reached a dead end after we lost the trail near Grim HEX. We currently don’t have the resources to investigate directly, but I have put in a request for a CI to follow up.\n\n

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Text=Millions of people from around the Empire come to visit Crusader every year. From stunning vistas planetside to a bevy of unique and memorable locations in the surrounding environs, there’s plenty of reasons why Crusader is considered by many to be “Above and Beyond.”\n\nWhat better way to explore the grand expanses of the Crusader than by riding aboard a Genesis Starliner that was built planetside by Crusader Industries. These luxurious cruise ships offer tours of not only the gorgeous upper atmosphere of Crusader proper, but offer a myriad of options and destinations. Why not start with a sunset tour to see a Genesis being built right before your eyes in the beautiful latticework of Crusader Industries; expansive shipyards? From there you can cruise along to the lower atmosphere to experience the colorful cacophony of one of our famous “light storms” or head out into orbit to visit the beautiful icy moon of Yela. Named for the oldest sibling in the childhood favorite fairy tale “A Gift for Baba,” a visit to this frozen landscape will surely have all the makings of a tale of your own.\n  \nFor more information on tickets and timetables, or to learn more about places to see and visit during your stay, please contact the Crusader Visitor Information Center.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\n•	Remember, this is a free flowing expression of your thoughts. Don’t hold back. Don’t edit. Be true and you will find truth.\n\n•	Impact over substance or transformation over rehabilitation?\n\n•	The medium is part of discussion as much as the discussion itself is a medium of the art, but when that message overcomes the piece, is that the ultimate goal? Should the work stand or topple? Stop to ask ‘what if’ but make sure the remaining question is always why.\n\n•	Found another critique - “Though the work is an assault on the space, there remains little bite behind the attack. The only kindness in the experience is that the all the leftover resin has been promised to a local art school. Hopefully it may find use as art yet.” This is what I need. This pain. \n\n•	While I had some concerns at first, I am thrilled that my new hab is proving a fruitful ground for inspiration. Leaving the comfortable familiar behind and embracing the chaos of Grim HEX has been so cathartic I have begun to count losing all my credits as a blessing. \n\n•	You see these other artists who “make it.” Denara with his looms lapping up the critic’s praise, or Tamsa and her painted ships. Their embracing of the commercialization of art is the very poison that is destroying our souls. To expose how deep this commoditization of Humanity would be a true work of inspiration.\n\n•	I watched an ambush today outside the base. It was thrilling and terrifying at the same time, but it was the aftermath that struck me the most. The silence after the predators had flown away, stripping the cargo of their prey, I found myself transfixed by the drifting hulk of the wreck. The twisted shapes losing all function and becoming pure form. Definitely a motif to be explored further. \n\n•	I met a woman today who goes by the name Threetoe. She told me that if she was to die she’d want to be floated out in the asteroids by ‘the Big Sister.” She explained how her mother used to read the ‘A Gift for Baba’ to her growing up and she always related to the character. It amazes me the impact these stories of our youth can shape our very being. What replaces them as we grow older? The stories stop, but the need persists. What are the fairy tales that give us comfort now? The answer came to me as my thoughts were interrupted by cries of “So Yum, So Wow” from a nearby Big Benny’s machine. This is how the story of Humanity will be told. This corrupt consumerism will be the monument that we leave behind. \n\n•	A monument for me to leave behind …\n\n
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Title=INSTALLATION 3 – IDEATION JOURNAL
mobiGlas_MissingBennys_Artist_mobi_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\nThe project is nearly finished. It's been a hard installation but the wonderful fatigue of my body is the most alive I have felt in months.  It took me all day, but I think I figured out how to fix the machine I've been having trouble balancing. Once I get that done, only two more to go. Nothing like overcoming challenges to reinvigorate the soul.\n\nI can feel in every essence of my being just how important this work will be.\n\nThe questions remains though, what is the best way to reveal this unprecedented work to humanity? Do I stay silent to allow the naturally curious be the chosen few, spreading the gospel of Benny until the masses descend upon the site eager to know real truth? Or do I anonymously message an art critic or two to help them along the way? \n\nIt is almost tempting to stay here and await their arrival just to see what their reaction will be.\n

mobiglas_AlphaStation_WelcomeMessage_BodyText=On behalf of our entire staff and Crusader Industries, thank you for choosing Port Olisar for your visit to the Crusader area. We realize that there are many fine stations available, so we sincerely appreciate your business and look forward to providing an enjoyable experience.\n\nWe would like to call your attention to two important services:\n\n*Accessing Your Ship*\nIf you arrived at the station in a personal craft, Port Olisar is proud to feature UniCorp Limited’s cutting edge all-in-one automated ship organization program, ASOP. To retrieve your vessel, visit one of the ASOP terminals located in the Ship Deck, and once selected, your ship will be delivered to an available landing pad. \n\n*Safety Protocols*\nFor the safety of our guests, Port Olisar has been declared an Armistice Zone. Combat is prohibited and the use of all personal and ship weapons is strictly limited. If you would like more information about the Armistice Initiative, please contact a staff member or visit the Advocacy on the spectrum.\n\nAlso, please note that Port Olisar and the area above Crusader are a UEE Monitored zone. Our Comm Arrays are linked to the UEE’s Emergency Communication Network (ECN) and, when operational, will alert authorities immediately if you are involved in an accident, crime or life-threatening situation. While traveling, please maintain an active CommLink to ensure continued usage of the ECN.\n\nAnd of course, feel free to take advantage of our other top-class amenities:\n\n*Big Benny’s Kacho-To-Go*\nWhenever you’re in the mood to “Grab Eat,” make sure to check out our Big Benny’s Kacho-To-Go vending unit featuring the original noodle recipe made famous on Lo and their new spicy Mathania Red variety!\n\n*EZHab Rest Area*\nWhatever the length of your stay, take a moment to relax in our comfortable and private EZHab sleeping accommodations available for rent. \n\n*Complimentary Shuttles*\nIf your travel plans include a trip to Crusader’s surface, Port Olisar offers daily complimentary shuttles to Platinum Bay landing park in Orison; featuring breathtaking views of Crusader Industries’ famous construction yards. For schedule information, please contact a staff member. \n\nIf there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable please do not hesitate to ask any member of our staff or myself. We would be delighted to help you. \n\nWith kindest regards,\nSelma Hoss\n\nManaging Director\nPort Olisar Station, Crusader, Stanton\n

mobiglas_Alpha_Aciedo_Contract_Body=We are looking to immediately hire temporary contract system technicians to assist in the maintenance of Comm Arrays located near Crusader. Previous experience a plus. Arrays require a hard reset so experience with EVA in a hazardous environment is a must.
mobiglas_Alpha_Aciedo_Contract_Title=Temporary Contract Position: Comm Technician
mobiglas_Alpha_Crusader_CommsWarning_Body=We wish to notify you that you may experience difficulties with your comm system while traveling in the vicinity of Crusader. We apologize for the inconvenience. Our security teams are currently working to correct this issue and have the errant Arrays reconnected soon.\n\nPlease note, this outage also compromises the Emergency Communications Network grid, so security forces will be unable to respond in the event of a ship malfunction or criminal activity. We highly recommend adjusting your flight plan accordingly.\n\nCrusader Industries thanks you for your patience in this matter,\n\nLorenzo Momar\nVice President, Interstellar Communications Division, Crusader Industries

I just got the estimate from the repair crew. It’s not good. The whole air filter system is going to need to be replaced and that’s going to take some time. Not to mention getting the extra expenditure cleared by Central is going to be a bit of a to-do after the struggle we had getting the last increase through the board.\n\nI’m afraid there is no way we can proceed with opening the station as planned, and, unless you object, I’m going to keep the patrols operating out of their existing posts and delay their transfers until we have a better grasp on the updated timeline.\n\nNot going to lie, it's a major setback. I know how much having this new facility operating meant to you. Darston and myself are going to do everything we can to help get us back on track. \n\nSee you tomorrow,\nPauline\n\nPauline Nesso\n\nFacilities Manager\nCrusader Security\nSecurity Post Kareah

We are sorry to inform you that after careful consideration and review, our investigation has revealed the cause of loss is not covered by the employee policy provided by Covalex Shipping.\n\nPersonal Life Policy 02107 02012000 notes the following exclusions under which benefits will not be paid if the loss:\n\n(A)	results from the Insured's alcoholism or addiction to drugs or narcotics; but not addiction which results from the administration of those substances in accordance with the advice and written instructions of a Licensed Health Care Practitioner.\n(B)	results from the Insured's participation in a felony, riot or insurrection, or involvement in an illegal occupation.\n\nThe preponderance of the evidence collected at Covalex Gundo Station and witness statements indicate that the insured was intoxicated to the point they he lost normal control of his mental and physical facilities and that this intoxication was a contributing cause of the accident.\n\nIt is against the law and considered a felony for an individual to cause the death of another by the operation of devices while under the influence of intoxicants. Even if there may be intervening factors between the fact of operation and the death of another. Felony exclusion makes no benefits payable. \n\nSince your claim was denied, you have the right to an internal appeal. You may request one by filling out a DCR-90 form. If you have questions regarding the information contained in this letter, please feel free to contact our claims department. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJessie Holzburg\n\nClaims Adjuster\nImperial General Insurance

It's ridiculous. There is no way that's true. I know my husband. Darnell had his problems but that's all in the past.\n\nI want you to go Covalex and send me evidence that my husband is innocent. But even if you find out he isn't, you'll still get paid. I know your time is valuable and really, I just want to know the truth.\n \nGood luck, and I hope to hear from you soon one way or another.

Needs to be more detail focused. One more strike? \n- Does a lot to help maintain crew morale. \n\nDarnell Ward Notes: \n- Was a little abrasive at first when he came back, but has settled back into a solid routine. Once in a while still have to remind him about watching his attitude. \n- Punctuality problems seemed to have gone away. Has been on time regularly for past 3 months. \n- Keeps personal space clean. \n- Can sometimes be too diligent in trying to figure out a problem. Over thinks things sometimes which means tasks can take a little longer than expected. \n- Also can lead to taking unnecessary risks. \n- Very proactive though. Will address issues without needing to be told to do so. \n\nNico Theolone Notes: \n- Very focused. \n- Gets job done. \n- Figure out how to mention deodorant thing??? \n\nKiyomi Santos Notes: \n- So far so good. Seems to be stepping into the position well. \n- Good attitude. \n- Reports could be a little cleaner. Have noticed a few typos and errors. Simple things. Should take the time to double check before filing. \n- Schedule rotation suggestion was a good one. \n- Possible candidate for advanced training \n\nMel Ososky Notes: \n- Needs to be more mindful of using mobiGlas during work hours. \n- Has helped to improve the distro rate. Moving more crates through thanks to oversight on the cargo manifests. \n- Can be territorial with responsibilities. Needs to be more willing to let others help. \n\nSelf Eval Notes: \n- Need to be better about respecting that personal hours. I have sometimes taken advantage of employees living onsite and it can blur the lines between on and off hours. Downtime is important. \n- Profits have exceeded the 3% growth mandated by Covalex, in large part to my management. \n- Employee retention has increased. Turnover rate has significantly dropped. \n- Need to be better about following up on things earlier. Don't assume employees are tracking deadlines.

murderspree_desc_0001=I got a bit of a sob story for you. Year ago to the day, Navy squad came and dusted some of my best. Spaced 'em in the middle of a job with nary a warnin'. Hardly seems right. \n\nNow I'm thinkin' it's about time to settle the score. Heard that there was a level 5 in system and it's too good of a chance to pass up. See, as long as your crimestat's that high, the brave little starmen are gonna be huntin' you down anytime security gets wind of ya. Here's what I say, let 'em. \n\nEvery one of them blues that comes to hunt you, you take them out first. Get ~mission(KillCount) of them and I figure that'll be justice for my crew and a fine payout for you.   \n\nOne little bit extra - once you land the first shot, I need you to do it all in a set amount of time: ~mission(KillTime). The same as it took them to wipe us out. Call me sentimental. 
murderspree_desc_0002=Since you're a level 5, I'm assuming you're one crazy bastard. Exactly the type I need to settle a bet I have going. \n\nMy idiot friend says there's no way someone could take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in ~mission(KillTime). I say that all you need is the right person for the job. Plus, as long as your crimestat stays that high, any security you run into should summon the Navy right to you. Easy pickings.  \n\nWhat do you say? Do it and half the winnings are yours. The timer starts as soon as you shoot the first one.\n\n
murderspree_desc_0003=I'm sure you're aware, but recently the Navy's been trying to clean up Stanton. As someone who's clearly no fan of the law, that's pretty bad for you, and even worse for me. I work for one of the big security firms in the system (not saying which) and all our jobs have dried up since the Navy started taking on a larger role.\n\nWhat I need is a disaster that can prove to the suits with the credits that the Navy aren't the saviors they think they are. \n\nYou're going to be my disaster.\n\nI'll pay you some serious credits to take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in under ~mission(KillTime). And with your crimestat at level 5, the heroic Navy will show up any time you run into security making it that much simpler. I’ll start the time once the first shot lands. Figure a spree of this magnitude should be enough to scare just about anyone into hiring my firm.

northrock_boarders_890J_desc_001=An executive client just informed us that their 890 Jump had been intercepted at ~mission(Location) and boarded by outlaws. They would prefer to have this handled privately owing to the sensitive nature of proprietary data that's being stored aboard. \n\nYour first priority will be to clear all outlaws as quickly as possible so that a recovery team can be dispatched to return the ship to the owner. The longer the outlaws have control of the vessel, the higher the chance it will be lost. I recommend you acquire a team for this outing to expedite matters. \n\nNote that thanks to a small contingent of Security Personnel who stayed aboard, all surviving members of the crew were able to flee in an escape craft. The current status of the remaining security is unknown, but just in case, keep an eye out for friendlies when you engage the hostiles.\n\nSecondly, if at all possible, the client is *very* interested in preventing the theft of the aforementioned data.

northrock_bounty_PVP_desc_rehire=Hey again,\n\nIt's been a little while, hope everything's okay. I know things didn't end on the best terms, but after discussing it over with management, I would like to offer you a chance to redeem yourself. You had potential and I hate to think that you didn't have a proper chance to show what you're capable of.\n\nApprehend ~mission(TargetName) and we can see about getting your employment status reinstated.\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

northrock_bounty_PVP_title_rehire=Pro Tem Suspect Apprehension (Reevaluation)
northrock_bounty_desc_001=Got issued another bounty that we could use you on. This one's for ~mission(TargetName). I don't expect them to go down easy, but that shouldn't be a problem for you. They're last know location was at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nSee that you get it done,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_002=Your services are needed once again. This time to track and bring down the notorious ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nDo me a favor and keep it as clean as you can, okay? Might be extra eyes on this one.\n\nThanks for handling this,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_003=Have a bounty for you. ~mission(TargetName). Not the most high-profile collar, but a nasty piece of work nonetheless. Be good for everyone in the system to have this settled. Their last known location was at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nGood luck on the hunt,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_first=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I may have reached out to you already, but just in case, I wanted to message you again. I'm a logistics officer for the Stanton branch of Northrock Service Group, one of the top rated private security firms in the system, and we are looking to expand our portfolio of qualified contractors.\n\nNow, even though you are certified by the Bounty Hunters Guild, Northrock will need you to complete a pro tem contract to make sure you're a good match. I'm thinking I'll start you off collecting the bounty on ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_rehire=So, enough time has passed that I got management to agree to giving you a second chance at being a bounty hunter for Northrock. If you are able to prove yourself capable of successfully completing a contract that is.\n\nApprehend ~mission(TargetName) and we can see about getting you reinstated. They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_fps_UGF_boss_desc_001=Hey, \n\nHave an interesting bounty for you. A high level criminal by the name ~mission(TargetName) has been located at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nBased on our intel, its highly unlikely that the target’s going to be sitting and waiting out in the open. You most likely will have to infiltrate the facility and draw them out. \n\nSomething like a large firefight should be enough to do the trick. \n\nBest of luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group\n
northrock_bounty_fps_UGF_boss_nocivs_desc_001=Hey, \n\nGot a contract for you that requires a bit more tactics than usual. A high-level criminal by the name ~mission(TargetName) is hiding with a large contingent of outlaws at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nOur intel suggests that ~mission(TargetName|Last)’s forces most likely will act as defensive line in order to protect their boss. My best guess is that you will have to deal with them before you gain access to ~mission(TargetName|Last).\n\nThat said, I don’t want you shooting indiscriminately. Sometimes these outlaws keep civilians around and they should be treated like non-combatants.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group\n
northrock_bounty_fps_title_001=Bounty Assignment: ~mission(TargetName) (?RT)
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_001=Convicted criminal ~mission(TargetName) has escaped from a local rehab facility and Northrock's been contracted to return the inmate to custody. In my experience, escaped prisoners tend not to give up peacefully, so use any method you can to find and subdue the escapee. \n\nMight be worth staking out spots where they could attempt to hack their record clean. Wouldn't be the first time a prisoner has tried to wipe their sentence after escaping.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_002=Northrock received a bounty on a prison escapee that goes by the name ~mission(TargetName). They'll probably try to lay low for awhile, but the best way for them to do that is to hack their record clean. I'd start by checking out local spots where they might be able to gain access to the network.\n\nAnd word of warning - expect a fight. People fresh our of jail tend to have extra motivation for not going back.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_003=Hey,\n\nGot a bit of a livewire for you. Convicted criminal ~mission(TargetName) managed to escape from lockup and are on the run.\n\nNo clear sign where they might be headed, but I'd say check any spots in the area where they might be able to hack their record clear. The smarter crooks tend to start there. \n\nBet they are not going to be happy about running into you.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_intro=Hey There,\n\nMy name is Braden Corchado and I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system. I may have reached out already, but we try to make it a point of approaching anyone who meets our high standards and encouraging them to complete a pro tem contract. \n\nYou can't do much better than become a Northrock contractor. We have a solid reputation for offering challenging and interesting work at a higher rate of pay then many of our competitors in system. \n\nNow, to get approved, you will need to apprehend one ~mission(TargetName). They have recently escaped from the detention center and your job will be to track them down before they can disappear completely off the grid. \n\nA little hint is that it's safe to assume that the target is going to go try to clear their record. I recommend triangulating your search between the detention center they escaped from and locations where they can hack into the record system.\n\nGet this done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI know it's been a little while, but if you are still interested in doing contract work for Northrock, I convinced the management to give you a reevaluation. If you can successfully complete a bounty for us, we can see about getting your employment status reinstated.\n\nThis pro tem contract is to track down escaped criminal ~mission(TargetName). Try your best to get to them before they can wipe their record at database access point or the job's going to be significantly more difficult.\n\nHoping we can trust you on this.\n \nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

northrock_groupbounty_desc_02=Advocacy have been hunting down a group, but haven't had much luck. Lucky for them, NorthRock is ready to pick up the slack.\n\nWe got a time restricted warrant for:\n- ~mission(Target1)\n- ~mission(Target2)\n- ~mission(Target3)\n\nBe careful when you engage the targets. I don't want any of them slipping the net and costing us credits. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_03=I feel like you've proven yourself capable, so I think you should be able to handle this time restricted group warrant. \n\nWe're sending you out to neutralize ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). They're most likely not flying together anymore, but at one point they were operating as a pretty cutthroat gang. Racked up quite the hefty felony list before they disbanded.\n\nIt'll be more dangerous trying to capture them all in time, but the payout should be worth it.\n\nFly smart,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_04=Authorities are pretty eager to capture a trio of outlaws in connection with recent crime spree: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nThey're in the wind at the moment, but I trust that you'll be able to track each and every one of them down.\n\nThe payout for apprehending all three should make up for the extra effort needed to capture them in time.\n\nGood luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_05=Northrock got handed a bounty for three criminal associates on the run: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nIf they're smart, chances are they split up, so be ready to hunt them down individually.\n\nGood news is that the pay should make dealing with tight time restriction and extra travel worth it.\n\nFly safe,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_intro=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I may have reached out already, but I wanted to be sure and introduce myself. I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system today, providing a variety of services to all major governmental bodies as well as various private concerns. The reason I am contacting you is because we believe someone with your skills could be a boon to our clients. \n\nNot only that, but I think we'd be good fit for you. Our contractors traditionally get a higher rate of pay than a lot of our competitors in system, and a lot of them tell me how they really enjoy being tasked with the challenging and interesting work we offer. \n\nNow, Northrock holds itself to such high-standards so before we can make anything official, you'll need to achieve approved contractor status by completing a pro tem contract. \n\nI was hoping you could capture several wanted members of an outlaw gang: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3).\n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_groupbounty_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI've been thinking over everything that went down and decided to speak to management. They've agreed to give you another chance but only if you successfully complete a contract for us.\n\nWe can look at reinstating your employment status if you can bring in this criminal trio:\n~mission(Target1)\n~mission(Target2)\n~mission(Target3)\n\nThey evaded the last Associate who went after them, so you bringing them all in would definitely earn you some points.\n\nHopefully you've gotten your act together since your last job.\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

Thankfully, they still seem to have the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) in their possession. \n\nNeed you to track this bastard down, recover the property, and return it to our client at ~mission(Destination). \n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_recoverspace_desc_0002=Just got a bit of good news. One of our sources got a tip on some stolen property we've been looking for.

p_protectandresupply_desc=*FOR IMMEDIATE SYSTEM-WIDE RELEASE*\n\nAttention, XenoThreat forces started to ambush Naval convoy ships transporting vital supplies while en route to INS Jericho station in the Stanton System. The Navy has requested CDF forces to help recover these supplies from the wreckage and safely deliver them to Jericho station. All available CDF volunteers are encouraged to provide support.\n\nPlease note that the supplies are highly volatile if not handled correctly. Use caution while transporting these materials:\n* Zeta-Prolanide degrades over time until breaking down completely.\n* AcryliPlex Composite becomes explosively unstable if damaged.\n* Diluthermex releases a destructive energy pulse if exposed to quantum travel.\n\nAlso, XenoThreat hostiles might still be in the area so be careful. CDF volunteers with combat experience are also urged to contribute by securing these areas from lingering XenoThreat forces.\n\nSAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.

recoverstolen_danger_0003=We did some preliminary scouting of the site and it should be clear, but experienced operators know better than to rely on that to keep them safe. 
recoverstolen_danger_0004=The thieves responsible might still be lurking around, so use caution. 
recoverstolen_desc=~mission(Description)
recoverstolen_desc_0001=We have been fortunate enough to track down a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) that recently was reported stolen. It is being held in ~mission(Location). We need an operator to go in, reclaim their property and return it to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger)
recoverstolen_desc_0002=An informant of ours has given us word that a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) taken from ~mission(Destination) is being held at ~mission(Location). We are seeking a independent operator to handle the retrieval of said ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) on our behalf and return it to its rightful owners. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger) 
recoverstolen_desc_0003=This rarely happens, but believe it or not some missing property that's been our radar just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Intact too! Now all we need is someone to give the whole thing a happy ending and return the ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to our clients at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger)
recoverstolen_desc_0004=After contacting us about a recent theft at ~mission(Destination), we were able to apply our tradecraft and trace their stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to ~mission(Location). All the hard work is done, all that's left is the actually physical retrieval. Think you're up for it? ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger)
recoverstolen_desc_0005=Every time you think criminals can't get any dumber, they surprise you again. These geniuses stole some~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) from ~mission(Destination) but we were able to trace it right back to their ~mission(Location). Should be a simple matter for an operator to head in, retrieve the item, and return it to its proper owners.~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger) Though if I'm being honest, I wouldn't be surprised if these draggers thought it was magic or something once they notice the ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) is missing. 
recoverstolen_desc_0006=Good news. After a client of ours suffered a theft, we were able to trace their ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to where the criminals were holding it at ~mission(Location).

recoverstolen_space_desc_0001=An independent investigation has resulted in the location of a recently stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) being tracked down.

recoverstolen_space_desc_0003=Small miracle. Some good folks over at ~mission(destination) had a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) stolen from them, but we've actually been able to track it down. Turns out some scag by the name of ~mission(TargetName) has the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) aboard their ship right now. However, a skilled operator should be able to hunt their ship down and return the property to where it belongs. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0004=A ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) was reported stolen by one of the workers over at ~mission(destination). As a nice change of pace, we actually got a solid lead on the ~mission(client) member that pulled the job who's currently going by the handle: ~mission(TargetName). Now all we need is a suitable contractor to handle the recovery operation on our behalf. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger) Serious applicants only. EDIT: ** THIS IS NOT A GUILD JOB **
recoverstolen_space_desc_0005=We have it on good authority that a stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) is currently aboard the ship of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(contractor) needs a pilot, preferably with combat experience, to retrieve the stolen property and return it to its proper owners at ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)\n\n*This contract agreement is considered at-will, and may be terminated at any time by either party.
recoverstolen_space_desc_0006=Got a break today.

refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastCareful=Pyrometric Chromalysis
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastCareful_Desc=This higher-than-average priced refinement process uses a series of very precisely controlled heating chambers to slowly extract the wanted material over the course of the thermal cycle and remove insoluble impurities through chromalysis to result in an above average yield.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastCareful_Details=Low Speed // High Cost // High Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastNormal=Gaskin Process
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastNormal_Desc=This process exposes raw material to quick bursts of Gaskin solvents to break down and remove impurities through inductive filtration. This fast but expensive process results in an average final yield. 
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastNormal_Details=High Speed // High Cost // Moderate Yield\n
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastWasteful=XCR Reaction
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastWasteful_Desc=This process employs an array of highly corrosive reaction agents to rapidly dissolve unwanted materials. Developed by the Navy to expedite wartime material production, this costly refinement method makes up for its lower than average yield with its high rate of turnover.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_FastWasteful_Details=High Speed // High Cost // Low Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalCareful=Ferron Exchange
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalCareful_Desc=This recently developed process returns a high yield of refined product at a slightly below-average rate for a nominal cost. By using a resonant distillation process inside a flux-retort, the desired materials can be separated from the raw slag while minimizing waste.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalCareful_Details=Low Speed // Moderate Cost // High Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalNormal=Electrostarolysis
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalNormal_Desc=This moderately priced electrochemical process uses a pure sample of the desired final material as an anode to attract and bond the chemically dissolved raw material resulting in an average yield percentage and processing time.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalNormal_Details=Moderate Speed // Moderate Cost // Moderate Yield\n
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalWasteful=Cormack Method
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalWasteful_Desc=This readily available and relatively quick process, invented by Art Cormack in 2321, injects the molten material with a stream of reactive gas that bonds with common impurities. The resulting insoluble byproduct can then be filtered from the refined molten slurry producing a relatively low final yield.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_NormalWasteful_Details=High Speed // Moderate Cost // Low Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowCareful=Dinyx Solventation
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowCareful_Desc=This process slowly sublimates raw materials in a pressurized Dinyx chamber and then over time recrystallizes the vaporization in zero gravity to remove impurities as off-cast and produce a high yield of refined product. 
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowCareful_Details=Very Low Speed // Low Cost // High Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowNormal=Thermonatic Deposition
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowNormal_Desc=Through slow application of repeated heating and cooling cycles, the raw materials can be separated according to their specific thermonatic properties and produce a moderate refined yield.
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowNormal_Details=Low Speed // Low Cost // Moderate Yield
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowWasteful=Kazen Winnowing
refinery_ui_ProcessingType_SlowWasteful_Desc=Despite its moderate processing rate and relatively low yield, Kazen Winnowing, first developed in the 22nd century, is still frequently used thanks to its relatively simple set-up and lower price point. Once the raw material reaches its liquidis temperature, high pressure gas is introduced and used to winnow any remaining impurities.

shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_FastAndExpensive=Electrostarolysis
shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_FastAndExpensive_Desc=This rapid but costly electrochemical process uses a pure sample of the desired final material as an anode to attract and bond the chemically dissolved raw material resulting in a very high refined yield percentage.
shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_FastAndThorough=Dinyx Solventation
shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_FastAndThorough_Desc=This extremely complex process rapidly sublimates raw materials in a pressurized Dinyx chamber and then quickly recrystallizes the vaporization in zero gravity to remove impurities as off-cast and produce a high yield of refined product. 
shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_SlowAndCareless=Gaskin Process
shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_SlowAndCareless_Desc=This process exposes raw material to readily available Gaskin solvents for an extended period of time to break down and remove impurities through inductive filtration resulting in an average final yield. 
shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_SlowAndThorough=Pyrometric Chromalysis
shop_ui_RefineryTerminal_ProcessType_SlowAndThorough_Desc=This moderately priced refinement process uses a series of very precisely controlled heating chambers to slowly extract the wanted material over the course of the lengthy thermal cycle and removing insoluble impurities through chromalysis to result in an above average yield.

shubin_claimsweep_desc_001=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA recently acquired Shubin Interstellar mining claim awaiting processing was discovered to have been jumped by a rogue mining outfit who are actively stealing ore from the site.  While local authorities have been notified, there is concern that valuable assets may be harvested before an official investigation can be launched.\n\nTherefore, as is our right as claim holders, we wish to secure a mercenary force to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries that are protecting this illegal operation, and clear the site for Shubin repossession. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.
shubin_claimsweep_desc_002=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA local Stanton independent mining team was working ~mission(Location) as Shubin Interstellar contractors when a hostile force attacked and took over the site. We believe that the perpetrators are still at the claim using the equipment left behind to harvest the valuable ore there for themselves.\n\nAmong the equipment lost were orbital sentries that had unfortunately not yet been fully deployed at the time of the attack. Long range scans of the claim have led us to conclude that the outlaws have activated the orbital sentries and are using them to protect their illegal operations.\n\nTo reclaim the site, we are seeking contractors to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries, and clear the site for Shubin repossession. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.

spacesteal_danger_0004=Not sure if the ship's gonna have escorts or not, so be ready for anything. 
spacesteal_danger_0005=I don't expect ~mission(TargetName|Last) to give you much trouble. They usually fly solo and if they do drag along friends, it's not much.   
spacesteal_danger_0006=I'm thinking grabbing the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) should be pretty straightforward since they usually fly by themselves. But even if they do dig up an escort, it's gonna be dreg pilots at best. Nothing you should worry about, really.  
spacesteal_danger_0007=From what I remember, ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually flies this little multicrew dragbox. Shouldn't be too much trouble, but it might get tricky if they've got friends along. 
spacesteal_danger_0008=I expect that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going to be flying what they normally do - a small multicrew thing. The real issue will be if they decide to bring any of their friends along to fly escorts. 
spacesteal_danger_0009=Word of warning. It might take a bit of doing to get the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) since they'll be flying a pretty hefty freighter and most likely the bastards will be bringing escorts along. Cost of doing business, I suppose. 
spacesteal_danger_0010=Be mindful that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going to be carting the goods in a pretty sizeable ship. Plus, they usually spring for extra security on top of that. Not gonna lie, it won't be easy, but the haul should be worth it.

spacesteal_desc_0002=Need someone to do a bit of aggressive acquisition for the ~mission(Contractor|Name). They got their heart set on a certain ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) and guess what? It's going to be sitting pretty aboard some hap's ship. All you got to do is pay this ~mission(TargetName) a visit, grab the goods, and fly 'em over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger)That's it. The credits are basically yours already.
spacesteal_desc_0003=Heard a few whispers that a ship's pushing off with some precious cargo aboard, but thanks to me and you, it's not going to stay that way for long. You're gonna find where ~mission(TargetName)'s ship is flying and relieve it of its burden. ~mission(Danger) Once you got it, drop the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) off at ~mission(destination) and the ~mission(Contractor|Name) will see that you're compensated for your efforts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed)
spacesteal_desc_0004=Payday! The ~mission(Contractor|Name) want a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that ~mission(TargetName) has aboard their ship and it's up to you to get it for them. Let me tell you, you're going to make some sweet, sweet creds if you're the one to bring it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) One last thing. I shouldn't even have to say this, but if you so much as think about keeping the goods for yourself, understand that you won't live long enough to enjoy it.
spacesteal_desc_0005=Attention - If your name is ~mission(TargetName), go ahead and save yourself a world of hurt and just bring the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) to ~mission(destination). If you're not that sap, then I'd like to present a business opportunity. How would you like to make some credits by chasing down ~mission(TargetName|Last) and taking the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from them? ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger)
spacesteal_desc_0006=Not sure if you remember this, but a little while back ~mission(Contractor|StealNickname) boosted this amazing haul but then immediately lost it like a giant idiot. Well, everyone and their grandmother has been looking for it, but yours truly actually found it. The ~mission(Contractor|StealItem)'s aboard the ship of someone named ~mission(TargetName). Now I never heard of them, but whoever they are they're going to regret every stumbling upon that stash. The ~mission(Contractor|Name) will pay us a finder's fee if we can grab it and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) Get it done and we'll both be legends.

ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_BrokenMoon=Taranis was discovered in 2478 by the famed UNE survey ship Mythic Horizon. Home to a Type-A Main Sequence star and four planets, the system only had a single high-risk candidate for terraforming in its initial scouting report. Shortly after discovery, the system was the site of a tragedy: one of Mythic Horizon’s survey boats was lost with all hands in a meteor strike.\n\nAlthough the system is sparsely inhabited, intrepid miners have been known to seek their fortune among the asteroid and lunar debris fields of the Taranis system. Criminal elements have also taken to the fields as refuge or to launch attacks.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Demien=Set up shortly after the UEE claimed Nexus system, Demien was one of the operations/housing/transfer stations set up for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II. The planet was never successfully terraformed though, because the station has a much darker reputation: the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935. This incident marked the first serious clash between the UEE and the criminal element that were driven out of their system.\n\nThe incident occurred in between shifts, when members of the Horizon Crew slipped aboard the station and murdered anyone they came across. One survivor managed to make it to a comm station and alert authorities. By the time they arrived, there were only outlaws left. Local authorities were significantly outgunned and were forced to call in the Marines to retake the base. The ensuing battle lasted for six hours as Marines and Criminals fought over every centimeter of territory.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_DyingStar=Modeled after the Pyro system, this lawless frontier system features a dim red dwarf known as a "flare star" at its core. Six burned-out planets remain, none of which are capable of supporting life due to the violent changes in Pyro's stellar luminosity. Between super-flare events capable of melting ice on the daytime side of Pyro IV, huge sunspots cover a large portion of Pyro's star, greatly reducing its brightness. 
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Echo11=A former extraction facility built into the asteroid that it was burrowing into. Echo11 was built by the Hathor Group and abandoned just like they abandoned the system. Since then, it’s become a den for squatters and outlaws.\n\nRecently, it’s been used for some of the more aggressive outlaw packs to stage surgical strikes on UEE forces. The base has been launched into the public consciousness after a series of high-risk Advocacy raids attempted to take out members of Argul Dawn who had been preying on supply ships for weeks.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_NewHorizon=Built on the planet Green in Ellis system, New Horizon is home to the Empire's most expensive hotels and extravagant casinos and has just recently been cleared to host both Classic and Blitz races\n\nSituated in the lower atmosphere of Green in the Ellis system, New Horizon raceway features some of the most beloved tracks in Murray Cup history. From the classic Old Vanderval route through the Defford Link, racers of all levels flock to the system to hone their skills for a shot at glory in the Murray Cup.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_PU=Located in the Stanton system, the space around the planet Crusader has become a bustling hub of transports and tourism. Managed by Crusader Industries, visitors are invited to visit the lunar beauty of the three moons; Cellin, Yela and Daymar, or enjoy a relaxing vista aboard Port Olisar.\n\nTravelers are advised to keep a close eye on their scanners as criminal activity has unfortunately been on the rise for the past year.\n

ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_desc=Equally capable of holding a client meeting as well as a ship, Aeroview Hangars have become the definitive choice for the discerning executive. Built with a proprietary modular system, an Aeroview Hangar can be customized around your needs, even accommodating larger ships than most other civilian hangar providers on the market. With an overlooking office space, you won’t ever be far from your business, wherever it may take you.
ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_history=Aeroview proudly claims to be the oldest established hangar manufacturer in Human space. Their design and construction of hangars goes back more than 300 years. In the 27th century, Arthur Nassir formed the company around a rigid code of business ethics focusing largely on design quality, a dedication to ergonomics, and an extreme respect for client confidentiality. Aeroview also famously reserves the right to refuse service to any non-Citizens. While hangar design and housing is tangential, at best, to piracy, Nassir’s outspoken contempt for those who fly outside the law led to the company’s code. When Aeroview was purchased by Shubin Interstellar, the conditions of the sale insisted that the code be adhered to in perpetuity. /n/nWhile the code remains intact, Aeroview’s original business model does not. The Aeroview hangars of the 28th century were palatial affairs built on a case-by-case basis to the specifications of the social elite capable of owning their own spacecraft. In recent years, Aeroview has adapted their tactics to follow in SELF-LAND’s footsteps (although they would never admit it). Instead of custom-building high-class hangars on an individual basis, they now produce a line of modular "business hangars" priced to sell to successful businessmen and other executive-level clients. Unlike other modular hangar companies, Aeroview does not lease the property on which their hangars are established. This is left up to the individual consumer to determine; the Aeroview hangar can be erected at any point in the UEE given 48-hours notification (24 hours, for a steep rush construction fee). Of special note, Aeroview has found particular success in developing hangars for larger scale craft or craft that require additional space for support equipment. Pilots of ships like Freelancers, with multiple crew housings, or Hornets, with weapons racks and a need for more intensive hull repair facilities, generally find it more cost effective to purchase a single Aeroview hangar rather than multiple SELF-LANDs.

ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_callout3=Super-Modernism
ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_desc=Excellence. Refinement. Function. These are the pillars that the architects at Revel & York hold dear when building a hangar facility. They understand that your hangar is not just a space. That it is an extension, a manifestation of its owner. Featuring handcrafted wood paneling, botanical gardens and dynamic wallscreens, Revel & York hangars will feel more like home than home.
ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_history=When the Revel & York engineering corporation set about designing its first hangar some thirty years ago, the reaction was laughter. The company, known best for excessively expensive and visibly uncomfortable furniture, was entering a field dominated by aerospace giants. The laughter ceased quickly as the Revel & York "deluxe" line of hangars became the de-facto spacecraft garage of the rich and powerful. The company’s cavernous hangars, established on ideal landing spaces in top-dollar land agreements, earned their standing reputation for excellence and quality. /n/nRevel & York designers work directly with pilots to develop a hangar experience like no other. R&Y is the only company currently constructing modular hangars designed to support merchantman-class spacecraft like the Constellation and Caterpillar, locking them into a valuable if small segment of the population. Their hangar designs have earned their reputation: between interlocking catwalks (with motorized lifts!) to allow pilots to supervise their spacecraft from overhead, to specially designed Greycat PV buggies for transporting ship crews from module to module, everything is designed for not just the elite pilots’ usability but also their overall enjoyment. SELF-LAND and competitors make a place to put your ship; Revel & York makes a place for you to take it in.

ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_desc=Affordable and utilitarian hangars available in every system of the Empire. Self-Land prides themselves on providing a safe and secure landing experience whether you’re in Terra or Fora. Their modular design and use of prefabricated materials means that Self-Land hangars can be constructed in almost any existing structure, leading to their extensive presence around the UEE.
ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_history=Incorporated by Peter Weathermen, a wealthy guild licensed shipper who made his living on the active spacelanes, SELF-LAND hangars have become an ever-present reminder of just how easy it is for Humans to travel the stars. The corporation was founded on the philosophy that the temporary hangars available to transiting pilots were inaccessible, unaffordable and most importantly unsafe. (Weathermen began developing the company after he was jumped by a gang of dock-thugs who stripped his Starfarer to the hull plating.) /n/nStarting in the mid-29th century, SELF-LAND began a franchising-based expansion across the Human-inhabited galaxy. The first SELF-LAND was established by Weathermen on Vann in the Croshaw System. Seemingly overnight, the company had expanded to a dozen worlds … and then a hundred. Today, the SELF-LAND corporation boasts that they maintain at least one facility on every world in the UEE, with some planets (Terra chief among them) having as many as sixty different complexes. SELF-LAND hangars are fully modular and environmentally controlled. Prefabricated out of the most available common metals, they aren’t necessarily attractive to look at … but they are comfortable and familiar. The SELF-LAND experience on a colony world near Vanduul space is exactly the same as that available to a pilot berthing on Earth. The SELF-LAND corporation takes care of everything, from structure design to land titles. Because of their design, the same hangar type can be used in configurations ranging from skyscraping heights, to the breadth of a plain, to stacked underground, or to honeycombed deep within asteroids.

ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_desc=For commercial and industrial needs, why not consider a hangar from VFG Industrial? Inspired by military design principles, their effective and durable structures are capable of sustaining inhospitable conditions. With a VFG hangar, there’s no such thing as off limits.
ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_history=Tom Vivien, Walter Fink and Ulla Gandil were members of the UEE Army Corp of Engineers who specialized in quickly building pressurized landing zones in combat zones during their service. They founded VFG Industrial shortly after being discharged and attempted to bring their expertise to the civilian market. With so many mining groups and terraformers out there, they believed there was a demand for functional and well-crafted hangars in 'non-ideal' conditions. They were correct, clients came in droves, until the Army attempted to sue them for patent theft. The lawsuit claimed that VFG's entire business was built upon proprietary design briefs written for and owned by the Army. VFG tried to settle in for a long fight, but soon began to run out of resources. With a freeze on their business, no more money was coming in, but the three refused to back down./n/nWhen things seemed bleakest, they received a reprieve, of sorts. ArcCorp was very interested in their hangar building methods, specifically for their mining and terraforming subsidiaries, but also to mass-market to the public. The members of VFG were divided. Fink utterly refused to sell to the MegaCorp, but the other two knew they had no choice. The three finally agreed to sell. ArcCorp's lawyers took over their defense and within a matter of weeks managed to work some backroom black magic to hamstring the Army's case. Fink took a substantial buyout and left the firm. Tom Vivien and Ulla Gandil are technically still on the board, but control of the company has shifted to ArcCorp.

vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_003=Believe it or not, but this assignment's name is near identical to one of my earliest contracts. I can't tell if that's because it's a popular name or if it reflects on my having been in the business a very long time.\n\nThat said, this ~mission(TargetName) is very different than the earlier one I dealt with. This one is traveling near ~mission(Location|Address) in a heavily fortified ship with well armed guards escorting them. \n\nIf I am not mistaken, they are going to put up quite the resistance, but hopefully this ~mission(TargetName) will soon be as dead as the first.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_intro=I will not skirt the truth of it. This will be my second attempt at dispatching ~mission(TargetName). The first time cost me a very talented asset.\n\nIt turns out that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is not only a skilled combatant themselves, but they travel with several highly skilled companions making them most difficult to kill.
