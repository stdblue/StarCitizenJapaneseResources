mtps_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ABOUT THE JOB\nmicroTech Protection Services need a security professional for a retrieval op at ~mission(Location). The location is currently under attack and security forces on-site are unresponsive and presumed dead. We believe confidential materials recently delivered to the facility for temporary holding were the target of the raid. Your main focus will be collecting those boxes and delivering them to a secure location.  \n\nFor security reasons, the confidential materials were delivered as part of a larger shipment and secured in the automated vault. The materials have unique retrieval codes that must be entered on the keypad at the package conveyor. Protocols require that only senior security officers can carry a datapad containing a code, but considering the volatile situation, we can't guarantee that the Nine Tails haven’t taken possession of them. Once secured, deliver all of the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1) for payment.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n• Provide own transportation to ~mission(Location|address).\n• Use force as necessary to collect the confidential materials.\n• Deliver the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1|address).\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS\n• 2 years of combined mercenary and/or security experience.\n• Access to combat equipment. \n• Access to a spaceship that can transport cargo.\n• Available for immediate deployment.\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n• Experience with rapid hostility de-escalation techniques.\n• Experience hauling important cargo.
