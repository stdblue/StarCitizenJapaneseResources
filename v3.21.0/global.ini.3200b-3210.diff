DIFF	mg_pacheco_DestroyEvidence_desc_001=It turns out that security over at ~mission(location|address) got their hands on a box of evidence that shouldn’t exist. I’m gonna pay you to destroy it for me.\n\nGetting to the evidence won’t be a walk in the park. You’ll have to make it past the station’s turrets and heavy security, and then take out the Chief of Security in order to get their access code to the Evidence Storage Unit. And even that’s not straightforward since the Chief only deals with high-level emergencies so I’m thinking you’ll have to shoot up the place pretty good before they feel it’s worth showing up. Bringing a crew with you and approaching the station carefully is probably a good idea.\n\nOnce the Evidence Inventory System is started up, the box I want should be easy to find - it's blue and has "EVIDENCE" written on it. Destroy that and I’ll get you paid.\n\nWhat you do after that is up to you. There’s probably plenty of other valuable crap locked up in the Evidence Storage if you’re willing to hang around long enough to grab it, but that’s on you.\n\n-Twitch\n
DIFF	mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_001=Long story short, one of my people got pinched with some evidence that could make things very uncomfortable for me and some of my associates. That’s why I want you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal it for me.\n\nIt won’t be easy. Not only is the station protected by turrets and crawling with security, but the access code to activate the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. In order to get to them, you’ll need to create enough havoc to force the Chief to come deal with you in person. I usually don’t like loud and messy, but this job calls for it. It wouldn't be a bad idea to approach the station carefully and bring a crew along to help.\n\nOn the bright side, the evidence I want should be easy to spot. The box is blue and says "EVIDENCE" on the side. Anything else you want to take from storage and sell is fine with me as long as you remember that I’m your priority. \n\nOnce you have my evidence, drop it off at ~mission(destination|address) and we can call it a day.\n\n-Twitch\n
DIFF	mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_002=I'll spare you the details, but I need a bit of leverage in a tricky negotiation and know exactly where to get it. That’s why I’m sending you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal a box of evidence for me.\n \nNow, I won’t lie to you. The job’s a toughy. The station is thick with turrets and security, and the only access code to the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. To make things worse, that snotty bastard doesn’t like to get their hands dirty unless it’s a full-blown emergency which means that you’ll have to escalate things before the Chief will even bother coming round.\n\nOnce you do activate the Evidence Inventory System, the box I want should be the first one out. Now, there might be more boxes coming out after it, you can consider those your bonus payment. \n\nJust be sure that you take care of dropping off my evidence at ~mission(destination|address) first and foremost.\n\nI figure if you approach the station carefully and bring the right crew along, we should all be able to get what we want. \n\n-Twitch\n
DIFF	mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Oh hello, I recently overheard a little bit of intel that ~mission(location|address) received some confidential materials that are of great interest to an acquaintance of mine. So interesting that they’re willing to pay for someone to storm the facility, grab the goods, and deliver them to ~mission(DropOff1|address). Now I expect there to be plenty of security, who will most likely put up a fight, so I’d bring a gun or two. \n\nWord is the confidential materials were delivered in a consignment alongside other stuff and are now being stored in the facility’s automated vault. Senior security officers on-site carry datapads containing retrieval codes used to access the vault. You’ll have to get your hands on a datapad before using the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nIf you need a little sweetener, I’ve seen the manifest and can confirm that the other crates being stored at the facility are pretty choice. My client could care less about what happens to them, so they’re yours to do as you please. Run this right and those extra crates could be a nice bonus on top of the delivery fee for you.
