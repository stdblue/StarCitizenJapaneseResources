Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_DescPointer=~mission(Contractor|QuantumSensitiveDeliveryDesc)
Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_001=Hi,\n\nWe are in a bit of a tight spot, over here at Covalex. A shipment of Diluthermex was accidentally delivered to the wrong location and we're looking to get it delivered correctly as quickly as possible. It's the least we can do for our clients. \n\nNow the tricky bit of business is that Diluthermex is a bit unstable when exposed to quantum travel.\n\nNormally, we would have a fully kitted cargo ship handle the delivery, but since time is of the essence, I'm hoping you can do it and just not QT while you have it aboard your craft. Not ideal, but as long as you have a full tank of fuel you should be fine.\n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nRemember, slow and steady but as fast as possible!\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Covalex Shipping is not responsible for any damages that occur while operating as an independent contractor.
Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_002=Hi,\n\nGot a problem that I'm really hoping you can help me sort out. \n\nA shipment of Diluthermex was mistakenly delivered to the wrong address and they need be correctly delivered as soon as possible. \n\nTo further complicate things, as you may or may not know, Diluthermex is quantum sensitive which means that you either need a properly shielded hold or you can't QT with it onboard. \n\nUsually, I would bring in a contractor who had the proper set up, but with everything already so delayed, I'm just going to trust you to deliver these the old fashion way.\n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nAnd since you're going to be flying at regular speeds, I definitely recommend making sure to top off your fuel tank before heading out. Don't want to get stranded half way.\n\nThanks again for helping me out of this bind!\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Covalex_QuantumSensitiveDelivery_Desc_003=Hi,\n\nSo it seems that some forms got processed incorrectly and a shipment of Diluthermex was mistakenly delivered to the wrong address. Unfortunately, we only realized the mistake after the original transport ship left the system and now I need another pilot to correctly finish the delivery.\n\nThe reason why it would have been better for the original ship to take care of this is that delivery was quantum sensitive Diluthermex. Without the proper shielding, I'm afraid you'll have to make the deliveries without using your quantum drives or risk damaging the shipment (and your ship). \n\nHere are the details -\n\n~mission(Itinerary)\n\nBut hey, flying a little bit slower can be nice sometimes. Just think about all the pretty views! As long as you got a full tank of fuel, why not sit back and enjoy the flight. \n\nAppreciate your help,\n\nChase Hewitt\nJr. Logistics Coordinator\nCovalex Shipping  \n'Anything you need, anywhere you need it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovalex Shipping is a limited liability corporation.

Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_E_Desc_001=A price has been set on the heads of ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). \n\nWhile having to hit two targets isn't that weird, the client wants to send a very specific message, so they need to targets hit at the exact same moment. The extra credits should make up for the hassle.\n\nAnd unfortunately since the pair aren't traveling together, it goes without saying that to pull it off you're gonna need some help. Make sure you bring people you trust can handle more than one ships since the targets are known to travel with backup. \n\n
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_H_Desc_001=Contract's for two targets that need to be taken out at the same time. \n\nGuess the client is worried that if they aren't eliminated together, one of them will go dark and try to get some revenge.\n\nThey go by ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2).\n\nFind yourself a team, divide and conquer.\n\nAnd make sure whoever it is has got skills, because these two have a reputation for holding their own in a fight and they for sure won't be alone. Be ready for them to give you some trouble. 
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Desc_001=Interesting assignment came my way. I need two separate targets taken out: ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) \n\nProblem is, either one gets word about the other being hit, they’ll go to ground. Can’t risk losing either of them. \n\nIt’ll take considerable coordination, but I want you to hit them both at the same exact time.  \n\nAnd since you can’t be in two places at once, you’ll need to find someone you can trust to help on this.\n\nThankfully, my intel says that both the targets should be traveling alone. That should help make things a bit easier on you.
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_M_Desc_001=Got a contract to take out two up and comers who've been stirring up trouble. It has to be clean, both done at the same time, or else they might cause even more trouble.  Long story short, you'll need some help on this one.\n\nBoth ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) know how to handle themselves, and the people they fly with aren't no joke either. You can expect each of them to be guarded by a few ships.
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_S_Desc_001=Normally, the pair of ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) would be too much to take on together. They both are about as good as it gets when it comes to dogfighting and the crew they fly with are almost as good.\n\nBut recently they split - not sure why - and are flying separate for the moment.  Someone thinks this may be the best chance to take them out. \n\nGather some personnel you can trust and plan a simultaneous raid against both targets. It's too dangerous to risk one of them living after such a direct move against them.
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_VE_Desc_001=Have another pair that need to be eliminated:\n~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2)\n\nThey've been in the wind for a few days now, but just popped up. If we don't get them now, I'm not sure we will get another chance.  You need to enlist a partner to make sure both targets are hit at the same time.\n\nAs far as them putting up resistance, ~mission(TargetName) is known to bring along a friend to watch their back, and I suspect ~mission(TargetName2) will do likewise. 
Eckhart_Assassin_Sync_VH_Desc_001=~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2).\n\nTwo serious operators who've recently decided to make a move against their boss. Each of the pair are traveling with a small, highly trained armada and cutting deep into territory that doesn't belong to them.\n\nYou, and whoever you recruit to help, are going to take them out and it has to be both at the same time so they can't regroup.

I'm willing to give you another shot, but you need to complete the following delivery.  \n\nPACKAGES FOR PICK UP (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup3|Address)\n\nDROP OFF LOCATIONS (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff3|Address)\n\nThanks, \nConni Ling\nShipment Coordinator\nLing Family Hauling
LingFamily_UGF_collect_desc_001=Hey,\n\nWe need you to grab a delivery for us over at ~mission(Location|Address) and then take it to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nI was originally going to send my brother Ricki to handle this, but he said the area’s too dangerous. Guess there’s been a bunch of security warnings around there, but as long as you’re careful and bring some guns or whatever, I’m sure you’ll be fine. You probably won’t even run into anything. \n\nThanks, \nConni Ling\nShipment Coordinator\nLing Family Hauling\n
LingFamily_delivery_desc_0001=Hi,\n\n~mission(Contractor|Reaction)Got another delivery for you. ~mission(Contractor|Family)\n\nThe shipment is waiting for pick up at ~mission(Location|Address) to be dropped off at ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nThanks, \nConni Ling\nShipment Coordinator\nLing Family Hauling

LingFamily_delivery_desc_0003=~mission(Contractor|Reaction)Got an upcoming delivery scheduled that could use you.\n\n~mission(Contractor|Family)The shipment is heading from ~mission(Location|Address) over to ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nThanks,\nConni Ling\nShipment Coordinator\nLing Family Hauling
LingFamily_delivery_desc_0004=Hello,\n\nConni normally does these so you'll have to bear with me. Still trying to wrap my head around the system she set up. Believe it or not, I used to handle all of this myself! Thank heavens for Conni though. She's so good at all this stuff. \n\nAnyway, if I'm reading the invoice correctly, the shipment is at ~mission(Location|Address) and needs to be hauled over to ~mission(Destination|Address). Simple enough. \n\nGood luck out there. Make the Ling family proud!\n\n-Davi Ling\nProprietor \nLing Family Hauling
LingFamily_delivery_desc_intro=Have you always been interested in trying your hand at being a delivery pilot but didn't know where to start? \nAre you sick of being taken advantage of by the large faceless shipping conglomerates? \nDo you want to further your career by gaining on-the-job experience with a top-reviewed family own company? \n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then Ling Family Hauling may be right for you. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nHi,\n\nI'm Davi Ling, proud owner and proprietor of Ling Family Hauling. For the past three years, my family has been making a name for ourselves delivering packages and hauling shipments in the greater Crusader area. But now we need your help. \n\nTo keep up with our growing list of clients, we've been seeking additional pilots to help our family to keep expanding. Right now, we have a shipment waiting at ~mission(Location|Address) to be taken to ~mission(Destination|Address). The perfect opportunity for a new pilot. No prior experience necessary. Whether this is your first time flying a route, or your thousandth, all we ask is that you work hard and try your best. That's the Ling Family way.\n\nSincerely,\nDavi Ling\nProprietor\nLing Family Hauling

ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_001=A claim has been processed for a ~mission(Location) belonging to one of our policy holders after the vessel was recently rendered inoperable.\n\nHowever, Olympus Principal has learned that there may still be valuable packages of zeta-prolanide onboard in a salvageable state. The successful salvage of these materials would go a long way in helping us recuperate our expenses, and as such, we are seeking a contractor to perform the retrieval operation on our behalf.\n\nAs you may know, zeta-prolanide is extremely volatile. If it is not kept in a powered stabilizer, it will grow dangerously unstable over time. We believe that salvage from ~mission(Location|Address) should still be stable for a little while longer, but be mindful as soon as they are removed you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nWhen approaching the incident site, please be on alert in case dangerous or hostile elements are still present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_002=Olympus Principal is seeking a salvage team to remove valuable packages of zeta-prolanide from a recently lost ~mission(Location). The hope is that the recovery of these materials will be able to offset any expenditures related to our client's claim of loss.\n\nAs you may know, if zeta-prolanide is not kept in a powered stabilizer it becomes extremely volatile over time. This will make any salvage attempt more complicated. \n\nOnce the containers are removed from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable. \n\nThere is a chance that word of this valuable salvage has gotten out to other interested parties and it is recommended that you proceed with caution in case there are hostiles present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_003=An inoperable vehicle claim has recently been filed by one of our clients for a ~mission(Location). The vessel was lost while transporting valuable packages of zeta-prolanide. It is our belief that those containers are still intact, and as the current property owner, Olympus Principal is eager to attempt to salvage them.\n\nWe are seeking professionals to handle this operation on our behalf owing to the dangerous nature of transporting zeta-prolanide once it is removed from a powered stabilizer. After you collect the containers from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable and lose all value to us. Please be very mindful of these time constraints.\n\nNote that other interested parties (possibly hostile) may have gotten word of the valuables onboard the wreckage, and extreme caution should be used in the area.

RedWind_Delivery_Illegal_Desc_Intro=RED WIND LINEHAUL\n'YOUR GOODS IN GOOD HANDS'\n----------------------------\n\nI know you've done some solid work for us in the past, so I figured I'd see if you were interested in handling a bit of a special run for us that's a bit farther out in the system than what you've been doing so far.\n\nIn a nutshell, we need a pilot who's willing to keep their head down, focus on getting the packages delivered, and most importantly, not ask a lot of questions.\n\nSee, for a smaller company like us, staying ahead of competition means that we need to offer our clients something they can't get elsewhere - discretion. At Red Wind, as long as you got the credits we'll take whatever to wherever.

Ruto_Assassin_Sync_E_Desc=Here's the deal. ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) need to die at the same time. Unfortunately, they aren't gonna be in the same place.\n\nA double hit can sound complicated, but if you hire some additional guns it shouldn't be all that hard to do two hits simultaneously.\n\nMake sure you find folks who have skills as I have it on good authority that each'll be flying with some escorts for "protection." 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_H_Desc=Have another pair that needs simultaneous deathing. Seems to be getting more and more popular as a murder option. \n\nThis time it's ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). Both are supposed to be pretty skilled operators and they won't be flying alone. \n\nI'd make sure whoever you get to help you on this one can handle a fight. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Desc=Guess what ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) have in common? \n\nYou're gonna kill 'em both!\n\nDifficult part is that I need you to kill them at the same time so that one doesn't have a chance to escape, or worse, kill the person trying to kill them. \n\nSo put together a team to track one target while you handle the other. Divide and conquer!\n\nAnd despite the fact they made a mess big enough to get themselves killed, my understanding is that they are relative lightweights. Don't expect you to meet too much resistance.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_M_Desc=I really hope that you're not buddies with ~mission(TargetName) or ~mission(TargetName2) because I need you to ghost the pair of them... at the same time...\n\nOf course they wouldn't make this easy on us and travel in the same ship or something obvious like that. No. You're going to have to put together a crew so that you can down both targets simultaneously. \n\nAs soon as one of them is dead, be ready to drop the other one too. Can't risk either of them getting away.\n\nAnd I figure I should mention that not only are both pretty good pilots, but that they'll be traveling with backup too. Nothing you can't handle I'm sure.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_S_Desc=If you had asked me, I would've said ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) would have wound up eventually killing each other. But instead you're going to get the honor of killing them both at the same time.\n\nYou're going to have to work for it, though.\n\nEach one is trouble. Serious records, highly trained, and too smart to fly without backup.\n\nGather the best crew you can on this one. You'll need it. And don't be stingy. You can't spend credits if you're dead.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VE_Desc=It's pretty touching when you run across a pair that's willing to die for one another. Stupid but touching.\n\n~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) chose to stand by each other and now its gone and got them dead.\n\nFind a friend of your own and hunt each of these two down. Make sure you kill them at the same time. Call it poetic justice.\n\nThey should die pretty easy. Maybe they'll have a ship or two with them but I don't think it'll be anything to worry about. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VH_Desc=~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). I think they may be related? Or dating? Doesn't really matter, someone wants them killed. \n\nI've arranged it so that you can hit them when they're not flying together. Safer for you this way. They are both serious business and fly with equally serious backup.\n\nMake sure you and your crew time your attacks. I don't want one of them left alive or it's going to be a real headache.

Rip the entire hull off so nobody can tell who it belonged to, don’t leave a speck of paint, and obviously keep your mouth shut about anything you see. \n\nWe’ll cred you up and anything you scrap is yours to keep.

You’ve probably got about ~mission(timer) minutes until security gets there to check out the wreck. Could be more, could be less.\n\nIf you’re fast enough, you can get in, get your haul, and get out without a shot fired. Not a bad deal, right?

assassin_danger_0004=Word of warning, no way someone like ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going down easy. You want to take them out? Do it hard and fast. 
assassin_danger_0005=While you should be careful, cause you never know - my guess is that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is gonna drop easy. Poor sod chooses to fly solo and hardly ever bothers with anything more than a few escorts. 
assassin_danger_0006=As for gearing up for this little job, you shouldn't need anything out of the ordinary. ~mission(TargetName|Last) prefers to fly alone. I mean, for a real special occasion they might travel with a friend or two, but I'd be surprised.  
assassin_danger_0008=Word is that the small multicrew ship ~mission(TargetName|Last) captains is being guarded by a few hired escorts. Can't say for sure if it's true, but good to be careful just in case.  
assassin_danger_0009=Rumor has it that ~mission(TargetName|Last) typically travels with a full escort so be ready to hit hard. Even if you do get lucky and catch them alone, you'll still have their ship to deal with and supposedly they captain a bit of a beast. 
assassin_danger_0010=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Since ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually captains a bigger multicrew ship and springs the extra credits for escort, something tells me you might need the extra firepower. 
assassin_desc=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDescription)
assassin_desc_0001=Looking for someone who doesn't mind getting their hands dirty. Not talking guild work or anything, just someone who's good enough to aim and squeeze. Got some good creds available to see ~mission(TargetName) permanently gone. \n\nStart looking at ~mission(Location). ~mission(MultiPlayer)~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0002=Got a mess that needs cleaning up. Paying solid credits for it too. The mess goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nBuddy of mine saw them around ~mission(Location), but the rest is up to you. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0003=There's a price on ~mission(TargetName)'s head. ~mission(MultiPlayer)Credits go to whoever bags the bastard first. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I'd recommend starting at ~mission(Location) but hey, don't let me tell you how to do your job. ~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0004=Guess who just got themselves placed onto the 'no-breathe-list'? Some dragger named ~mission(TargetName). Yeah, I never heard of them either, but better them than us, right? \n\n~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)Word is they've been haunting ~mission(Location) lately, so you'll probably want to start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)Good luck.
assassin_desc_0005=I don't know what ~mission(TargetName) did, but they sure pissed off the wrong people. Credits go to whoever can give them a last lesson in manners straight through the head. ~mission(Danger) \n\nThere isn't much to go on, just some scattered sightings around ~mission(Location), so maybe start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)~mission(MultiPlayer)One last thing, the client wants you to say '~mission(Phrase).' when the trigger's pulled. Don't ask. Just do it. 
assassin_desc_0006=~mission(TargetName) is breathing borrowed air. Time's come to punch their ticket for good. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I can give you ~mission(Location) but you have to provide your own transport and clean weapons. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0007=You know how they say the good die young? It's definitely true in this case. A hit's been put out on ~mission(TargetName), a local security thug that's hellbent on being a hero. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0008=Why don't these security assholes ever learn to mind their own damn business? It's like they want to get murdered. Especially this one. Name's ~mission(TargetName). Been stirring up huge trouble lately, but you're gonna put a permanent end to that.\n\n~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Knowing these security types, don't be surprised if they call for back up.
assassin_desc_0009=About time someone put ~mission(TargetName) in their place. This security hackjob's been taking bribes to look the other way, but the greedy little idiot decided to raise the rates. Big mistake! \n\nNow instead of those credits going to pay the smug bastard off, they're being used to pay you to murder their ass. That's some poetic justice right there. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0010=This bounty hunter by the name of ~mission(TargetName) made the mistake of messing with the wrong crew. They're looking to even the score and are offering pretty decent creds to whoever does the deed. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0011=I love it. This is one of those classic 'the hunter has become the hunted' scenarios you always see on the spec. \n\nA big bounty's been placed on the head of bounty hunter ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) It'll be interesting to see how they like it when they tables are turned. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_easy=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationEasyDescription)
assassin_desc_first=Listen, I know you don't know me, but that's kinda the point of this little experiment. We're just two complete strangers helping each other out. \n\nHere's how this works - I give you a name. ~mission(TargetName), for example. Then I'll tell you a place: ~mission(Location). Now, if by some complete and utter coincidence, they wind up shot to death a little while later, a bunch of credits will mystically appear in your account. Long story short, ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) has some bad luck, you have some good luck. Everybody's happy.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other people eager for the help of a dependable stranger and if you do a good job here, I'll make sure they know you're the stranger to talk to.\n\nGood luck out there.

bitzeros_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Hey,\n\nSome interesting intel just spun into our orbit. Seems ~mission(location|address) got some confidential materials delivered to them on the sly. Anything they’re going those lengths to hide’s got to be worth something, right? That’s why we’re shelling out primo creds to anyone willing to breach the facility, snag the confidential materials, and drop them off at ~mission(dropoff1|address) for us.\n\nGonna be honest with you, part of why we’re not doing this one ourselves is it’s probably gonna be a mess. See, the confidential materials arrived alongside other boxes in a consignment now stored in their automated vault and the retrieval codes for that are only generated on-site. That means no remote hacking. Our source claims senior staff carry datapads with the codes on it, so you’ll have to liberate datapads off them before using the codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nBut the gig’s got some perks. The consignment includes other crates that we don’t really give a crap about that are probably worth something too. \n\nSo what do you say?\n\n- Bit Zeros \n

blacjac_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Cargo Handling Experience\n\nNine Tails are currently assaulting one of our facilities at ~mission(Location|address). As they just received a delivery of confidential materials, we don’t believe this is a coincidence. BlacJac needs someone to hurry to the location and secure these important boxes before the Nine Tails do. You are authorized to use lethal force against any who attempt to stop you. \n\nAs part of our standard security protocol, the confidential materials were integrated into another consignment and secured in the automated vault. You’ll need to find the relevant retrieval codes for the consignment and enter it at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Retrieval codes are stored locally on datapads and only given to high-ranking staff, so you’ll have to locate them first. Hopefully they’re alive to help you, but considering the complete comms blackout, we fear that’s not the case.  \n\nOnce you’ve gathered all the confidential materials, they will need to be delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). Payment is contingent upon their delivery.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_UGF_defend_E_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nOne of the sites under BlacJac’s purview has been clashing with a few local outlaws. We would like you to head down to ~mission(Location|Address) and secure the site from these hostile threats.\n\nFrom the early reports, I expect this will be a fairly straightforward matter, but if it makes you feel better, feel free to recruit a team to provide you with extra support.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_UGF_defend_S_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nUnfortunately, BlacJac has received credible intel that a well-armed force is planning to make a move against ~mission(Location|Address). I need you to organize a team capable of protecting the site.\n\nFrom what we've heard, the attackers are highly-trained and very motivated, so don't even think about trying to handle this yourself. If you’re going to be successful, recruiting a team of skilled mercenaries is a must.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_UGF_defend_VE_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nIt seems that ~mission(Location|Address) has been receiving threats from a couple of local thugs. BlacJac is looking to have you go down there and protect the site from these outlaws.\n\nNone of the criminals in questions have much of a record, so they shouldn’t pose too much of a threat. That said, having a few other mercs along to watch your back is never a bad idea.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_UGF_defend_VH_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nI’ve received a report that some operators are planning on making a move against ~mission(Location|Address). BlacJac wants you to put a team together and defend the site from this dangerous threat.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you do not attempt to do this contract solo.

blacjac_UGF_defend_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nWe’ve gotten word that some local muscle have been making threats against ~mission(Location|Address). BlacJac is looking to have you put a team together and protect the site from these hostile threats.\n\nAnd as much as we all love credits, I don’t recommend trying to do this one solo. Hiring a team to come along would be beneficial to your livelihood.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_UGF_destroy_E_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nIt seems there’s a new operator trying their hand at manufacturing drugs over at ~mission(Location|Address), but the product they’re putting out is extremely toxic. \n\nWe’re sorting through how to handle the arrests, but the important thing is to prevent any more of their supply getting distributed. I need you to get down there and destroy the drugs they’re storing on site.\n\nThere's a good chance the facility isn't abandoned, so you might run into these thugs when you head down there, so be ready for a fight. But if their gun skills are anything like their chemistry, it probably won’t be much of one. \n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_UGF_destroy_H_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nSome enterprising chemists have cooked up a new product that is twice as potent and twice as deadly as the normal stuff. We were able to trace some samples back to the source over at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nBlacJac wants you to head down ASAP to destroy the entire batch before it can hurt any more of the population. We can worry about making arrests later.\n\nFrom everything we know about this crew, you should expect to meet heavy resistance while attempting to clear out the stash.\n\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_UGF_destroy_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nWe got word that a syndicate spiked a rival’s drug package and its causing chaos on the streets. Forensics have identified the source, a production facility over at ~mission(Location|Address). Word is the drug manufacturers don’t even know they have a poisoned crop on their hands.\n\nWe’re sorting through how to handle the arrests, but the important thing is to get this crap off the streets now. I need you to get down there and destroy the drugs they’re storing on site.\n\nThey won’t be happy about it, so you’ll probably have a fight on your hands, but the important thing is clearing out the product.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_UGF_eliminateall_allies_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nWe’ve gotten word from the security team at ~mission(Location|Address) that some of the local scum have been launching attacks.

blacjac_UGF_eliminateall_allies_desc_intro=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nBlacJac is seeking to expand our roster of security professionals. To evaluate if you’re a good match, we would like you to provide support at ~mission(Location|Address) as they've been having issues with some hostiles in the area.\n\nIf you are able to assist in protecting the site and eliminating the threat, we will be able to offer you more security work.\n\nNote that Friendly fire incidents will not be tolerated.\n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_UGF_eliminateall_allies_desc_rehire=ATTN: Former Mercenary Operator\n\nI’m aware that BlacJac stopped offering security work, but due to staffing changes it was decided to offer you another chance.\n\nWe’ve gotten word that ~mission(Location|Address) needs some assistance dealing with a local outlaw gang. BlacJac is looking to have you go to the site and assist in eliminating this threat.\n\nAnd since you’re already on thin ice as is, I don’t want to hear that you were involved in any friendly fire incidents.\n\nIf you’re able to pull this operation off, we can see about getting you reinstated.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_UGF_eliminateall_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nWe’ve gotten word that ~mission(Location|Address) is being used by some local criminals as a base of operations.

blacjac_UGF_eliminateall_nocivs_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nWe’ve gotten word that ~mission(Location|Address) is being used by some local criminals as base of operations. BlacJac is looking to have you sweep the site and clear out any hostiles. \n\nOur early reports show that there’s a good chance that the gang will have some civilians working for them on-site. We're not looking to be making headlines here, so try to remember that you are only cleared to engage with confirmed hostiles. \n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_basesweep_desc_01=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nBlacJac is contracting operators to help us clear ~mission(Location|Address) of illegal occupants.

blacjac_bounty_desc_ERT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nYou might have heard of ~mission(TargetName) before. They’re an extreme-risk target and they’ve been making headlines recently. The hope is you’ll be able to put together a response team and help BlacJac shut them down for good. Our most recent intel has their sub-capital ship and heavily armed escorts flying over at ~mission(Location|Address).\n \nI’d recommend making sure you’ve got an up-to-date imprint before heading out. Just in case. \n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_HRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nYour next bounty, ~mission(TargetName), is definitely considered a high-risk target for good reason. They’re known to travel with some serious firepower and are escorted by enough protection to make anyone think twice about picking a fight.\n\nSources indicate that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is hiding out over at ~mission(Location|Address). When you head out to track them down, just make sure you’re prepared. Might even think about bringing along some backup yourself.  \n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_LRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nBounty came in for a low-risk target by the name of ~mission(TargetName). The target themselves isn’t all that much to worry about, but it seems that they typically fly in a pack, so there’s a high chance they’ll have a few friends along when you track them down.\n\nSpeaking of, I’d start the hunt over at ~mission(Location|Address) since we have reports of them being spotted in the area.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_MRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNeed you to sort out ~mission(TargetName), a moderate-risk bounty last seen at ~mission(Location|Address) flying a small, multicrew ship. \n\nWe weren’t able to get details on exactly what they were piloting, but it seems they did have a few other ships with them. Be ready for a fair bit of resistance when you come calling.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_VHRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nBlacJac just got word that a very high-risk target, ~mission(TargetName), was spotted moving through the flight lanes over at ~mission(Location|Address) piloting a formidable ship with a heavy escort.  \n\nWe want this bounty closed out before they commit any more crimes. Gather whatever resources or support you need, and head out as soon as you can.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_VLRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a very low-risk target I need you to take care of: ~mission(TargetName).\n\nTheir last known location was ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nThis is a low threat bounty, so I expect you to be able to clear it pretty fast. They typically fly a small ship and don’t have very many known acquaintances. It doesn't get much more straightforward than that.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_intro=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNot sure if you’re interested, but BlacJac is looking to expand our roster of bounty hunters. We got more jobs than our current contractors can handle, so I’m hoping that you might be able to help pick up some of the slack.  \n\nYour qualifications look good on paper, but before we make anything official, BlacJac needs to see how you perform in the field firsthand. Even got a test case all lined up – we want you to sort out ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). Should be a fairly straightforward bounty without too much resistance. Perfect thing to sharpen your teeth on.\n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_rehire=ATTN: Former BlacJac Bounty Hunter\n\nI know your last sting bounty hunting for BlacJac didn’t go well, but a soaring caseload means that you are lucky enough to get another chance.\n\nIf you're able to complete the bounty on ~mission(TargetName) over at ~mission(Location|Address) then we can see about getting you reinstated.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_fps_UGF_bountyonly_desc_001=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a bounty for you. Goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName).

blacjac_bounty_fps_UGF_desc_001=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a bounty that needs to be collected on ~mission(TargetName).

blacjac_bounty_fps_desc_first=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nI have more bounties than I have bounty hunters at the moment, so I'm looking to expand our roster. \n\nIf you do a good job on this first one, there'll be more contracts to follow. \n\nLet's see how you do trying to deal with the bounty on ~mission(TargetName). They're believed to be hiding over at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_bounty_fps_desc_rehire=ATTN: Former BlacJac Bounty Hunter\n\nI know BlacJac stopped giving you bounty contracts, but times change and here we are giving you another chance.\n\nIf you're able to complete the bounty on ~mission(TargetName) over at ~mission(Location|Address) then we can see about getting you reinstated.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nWe have a problem over at ~mission(Location|Address). Apparently someone set up PDC Monitors to illegally skim data. \n\nYou are being tasked with locating the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroying them. \n\nThere are a few possible complications:\n- These things are designed to operate passively with as low of an EM sig as possible. Finding them might take some effort and thorough scanning. \n- Monitors like these often have automatic security protocols so that if they are attacked, they begin to transmit any stored dated. It's vital you destroy them before the upload can finish.\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nI'm hopeful you'll be able to resolve the issue before any more data is stolen.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0002=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nReceived a report that some enterprising criminal has been skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address) using PDC Monitors. \n\nYou are being tasked to locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroy them. I suspect it might take a bit of scanning to locate the monitors as they're designed to operate passively. Plus, as soon as you start attacking, their security countermeasures are going to kick in and attempt to upload their data-drives. You'll need to be fast enough to prevent the transfer. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks for taking care of this,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0003=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nI need a merc who can handle locating and destroying PDC monitors that have been illegally skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address). This will take some doing as the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) will be operating passively and difficult to find without performing a thorough scan of the area.

blacjac_destroystash_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nWe're looking for experienced professionals to participate in a raid on a suspected narcotics stash known as ~mission(Location|Address). We need to clear them out before they have a chance to move the product to another site.\n\nWe need you to secure and destroy any and all narcotics found at the stash using whatever means necessary, so go nuts. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nYou'll be paid out for however much of the contraband you personally destroy. Basically, feel free to engage with any lowlifes you come across, but that's not what you're getting paid for - BlacJac's focus for this op is the drugs. \n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroystash_desc_002=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nAn informant provided us with info on a narcotics stash known as ~mission(Location|Address).

Basically, do what you can to keep most of the surrounding area intact. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nYou'll be paid based on how much of the drug stash you personally clear out. Getting this product off the streets is a huge win for BlacJac, and of course the people of ArcCorp.\n\nGood hunting,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroystash_desc_003=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nThe location of long suspected narcotics stash known as ~mission(Location|Address) has finally been confirmed and we need to raid the site before they have a chance to migrate again. \n\nDestroy any and all drugs found at the site using whatever means you have. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nAnd remember, you'll be reimbursed based on how much of the narcotics you personally eliminate, not how many drug dealers you wipe out.

covalexrand_desc_0001=Been waiting forever for Covalex to get their act together after the accident they had, but I just don't think it's going to happen at this point. Hoping you could go out to Gundo and grab my order for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)I don't need you to take it all the way to me either. I arranged for shipment from ~mission(Destination) so all you'd have to do is leave it there at the front desk for me.\n\nThanks,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0002=I had an important shipment with Covalex and apparently it was waiting at Gundo when they had that big accident there. They said the delivery was going to be delayed, but it's been months now and they're still telling me the same exact thing. No new information or anything. I'm losing a ton of money on this and the best they can offer me is an apology. Not good enough. Figure if they can't finish the delivery, I'll find someone who can. ~mission(Reference) Need it delivered to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0003=Hey, a gift I ordered is stuck out on that Covalex station that exploded or whatever and now they say they can't deliver it. I'm really sorry about what happened there, but I already missed our anniversary and if I miss their birthday too, I'm gonna be dead. Basically, I need that box to be at ~mission(Destination) by any means necessary. ~mission(Reference) ~mission(Timed) 
covalexrand_desc_0004=Look, we can all agree it was a real tragedy what happened out there at Gundo, and I'm sorry people lost their lives, but that doesn't mean I don't need my package delivered, right? And if Covalex isn't willing or able to do it, then I have every right to go and get delivered on my own. That only seems fair. ~mission(Reference)If you're interested, I'll need it taken to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)\n\nGood luck,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0005=I'm in a bit of a bind. A delivery I've been expecting was rerouted through Covalex's Gundo station out near Crusader, but an accident there stopped all shipments. I tried getting a refund, but the company I ordered from says it's Covalex's fault, and Covalex says that their terms of service covers a delay like this. ~mission(Timed)I guess at this point I just want my package and I don't really care how I get it. Even to the point where I'm willing to pay the extra shipping to have someone just take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)
covalexrand_desc_0006=I need someone with access to a ship to fly out to Covalex's Gundo station and take a box there to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Reference)And before you get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not talking about stealing or anything, because it's my package. Covelex is just dragging their feet delivering it because of the investigation or safety or whatever excuse they're using. ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0007=A package I ordered is stuck because of the accident that happened at Gundo. I paid good creds for this and now it's just sitting there gathering dust. Seems to me that if Covalex isn't gonna do anything about it, then I might as well pay someone to find it and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0008=I am going crazy. Covalex keeps telling me that they delivered my package, but I didn't get it. The last routing information I have places it at their Gundo center, so I'm thinking that it got misplaced when they had the big accident there. ~mission(Item) If you could go check it out, I bet you anything that it's just sitting there. ~mission(Reference)If it is there, I'll pay to have you bring it to ~mission(Destination).

covalexspec_description_0001=Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at ~mission(Destination), I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya
covalexspec_description_0002=My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed
covalexspec_description_0003=Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to ~mission(Destination) for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace
covalexspec_description_0004=My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to ~mission(Destination), so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone
covalexspec_description_0005=They said that I could find someone here to go to Gundo for me and grab a crate that belonged to my wife. If the name didn't ring a bell, that's the station where they had that big accident. My wife worked for Covalex and I know it's not really going to make losing her any easier, but I really just want Claudia's stuff back. I think about her photo collection or the necklace I gave her just sitting there in that cold dead station in some box marked 249 and it's not right. She deserves better. So how about it? You willing to go to Gundo and haul her crate back to ~mission(Destination)?
covalexspec_description_0006=Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to head to the Covalex Gundo station near Crusader and grab some items. I know this may sound like stealing, but it's my dad's stuff. You see, he was on Gundo station when it had its accident. My mom says that we need to wait until Covalex says so, but I don't think that's fair because I miss him so much. I would like something to remember him by and I don't want to wait any longer because I might start forgetting things. I'll pay you to get box 510 for me and take to ~mission(Destination) so I can have it.\n\nThank you very much,\nBaylor Ward

criminal_blackbox_recover_desc_03=Some idiot crew went and got themselves dead. No big deal. Happens every day, right? \n\nTrouble is, seems like there's some pluggers interested in figuring out the how, and the black box is still sitting out there waiting to spill everything.\n \nNeed someone to take the stupid thing from the wrecksite over to ~mission(Destination) so it can be properly destroyed, and the mystery of who did what can stay a mystery.
criminal_blackbox_recover_desc_04=People are starting to snoop around and try to figure out what happened to this missing crew. That's a problem.

The kind of happy that pays good credits.
criminal_blackbox_recover_desc_05=We all do things we kinda regret, right? Well, someone might have gone a little overboard and now there's a black box full of incriminating data that needs to be boosted and taken to ~mission(Destination) before anyone else can find it.

criminal_recoverstash_desc_02=Turns out my perfect hiding spot is not that perfect.\n\nJust got word that a crew might be on the way to pinch my stash.

criminal_recoverstash_desc_03=A cousin of a friend of mine got shafted by their crew and decided the best way to settle the grudge was to let me know about the stash they have hidden away. Always pays to treat your crew well doesn't it?\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find their stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nIt wasn't clear if they were guarding the spot or not, so there's a chance you could run into some resistance. There's a few extra creds coming your way if you do.
criminal_recoverstash_desc_04=Thank the stars that dumb outlaws will always talk too much when they're hopped up on rot. This one git I was drinking with blabbed about a score they had secreted away in a hidden spot.\n\nFigured we could teach them a lesson about the importance of holding your liquor.\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find their stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nThere's a chance this bumbling idiot and their friends might be hold up there too, so be careful. If you do run into trouble, I'll give you a bit extra on top to make it up to you.
criminal_recoverstash_desc_05=Not a lot of people know this but, a few days ago my stash got raided by some clueless fetchlicks who decided robbing me was a smart thing to do.\n\nWell, it turns out it wasn't cause I was able to track the numcells down to where they're hiding. You're gonna go teach them a lesson for me and get my stuff back.\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find all my stolen stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nNot sure if they'll be hanging around when you get there or not, but if you end up coming across these asshats, I'll see you get some extra creds for the hassle.
criminal_recoverstash_desc_06=Took long enough, and I had to call in almost every favor I had, but I finally managed to track down that pecks that raided my stash. \n\nYou're gonna steal it back for me.\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find all my stolen stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address)\n\nAnd if the idiots who did this are there, I'll make sure you get a little extra reward for the extra risk.
criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_01=It pays to keep an ear open, and in this case, it pays very well.\n\nDiscovered where a nice little treasure is being secreted away, and with your help, we can take it for ourselves.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation) and  find all of the stash hidden there. You may have to hunt around a bit since its probably wont just be sitting out in the open.\n\nOnce you have it all, bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address) and I'll pay you your cut.\n\nIt's not clear yet if the site is being guarded or not, but we'll know for sure one way or the other once you're there. If there is resistance, you'll be compensated for taking the extra risk.
criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_02=You in the mood for a bit of a treasure hunt? \n\nOne of my crew was snatched recently and overhead some other scavs talking about how they had hidden away some pretty choice loot before being locked up. \n\nYou're going to steal it for me.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation). That's where they stashed the loot. \n\nOnce there, you're on your own to search the area and find where everything is hidden.\n\nAfter you found all of the stash, haul it over to ~mission(Destination|Address). Payment on delivery.\n\nLast thing. Not all of their gang was caught so there still might be a few hanging around. Don't worry though. If they're there, I'll throw some extra creds your way to make it up to you.
criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_03=Not sure if you've been hearing the rumors, but I think I figured out where that gang that pulled that big score last week hid everything they stole.\n\nIt's just sitting out there while they wait for the heat to die down. Real shame if anything happened to it...\n\nFor example if someone were to go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation), search around, find where all the stolen loot is, and bring all of it to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nBet a person who did something like that would stand to make a lot of credits.\n\nOf course the biggest risk would be if there were guards in the area, but if that were the case, I'm sure a bonus payment would make it worth the trouble.

Luckily, there's one ready to be dropped at ~mission(Location). Grab the ~mission(Item), set it up in range, and the credits are yours. ~mission(Danger) 
deploypiggyback_desc_0003=Gonna need a ~mission(Item) dropped by ~mission(Destination) if someone's got the time. This is a ~mission(Client) gig, so no messing about, okay? Oh, one more thing. ~mission(Danger)Have fun.
deploypiggyback_desc_0004=Here's the job. Pick up a ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location). Drop it off at ~mission(Destination). Pay on completion. No questions.
deploypiggyback_desc_0005=So, here's the deal. ~mission(Client) need a bit of work done and are willing to pay for it to get done right. Regs are simple. Go to ~mission(Location) and snag a ~mission(Item). Take it over to ~mission(Destination) and drop it off. The ~mission(Item)'ll do the rest and you get paid. Simple, right? ~mission(Danger)
deploypiggyback_desc_0006=The ~mission(Client) are cookin' up something juicy, but need a little extra intel, i.e. they need a ~mission(Item) placed at  ~mission(Destination).

destroyprobeillegal_desc_0001=The ~mission(Contractor|Name) are fed up with their ops getting busted near ~mission(Location). Turns out, there's ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) in the area listening in on everything we do. No wonder they keep getting busted. Take care of the problem for them and there's a nice little payday waiting. \n\nJust know that you'll need to scan the area since PDC Monitors like this are a pain in the ass to find and they're programmed to package up their data once they're hit, so knock 'em out quick. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0002=The area around ~mission(Location) has become a huge headache for some associates of mine since security's listening in on anything said or done out there. The ~mission(Contractor|Name) found ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) nearby and need someone special to go hunt down these sneaky little PDC Monitors. They're a real pain in the ass to find, but having to scan the area for them's only half the problem. \n\nOnce you take a shot, boom, they're programmed to shut down and upload their data back to central. You gotta blast them to bits before they finish. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0003=Interested in a little target practice? Head over to ~mission(Location) and turn security's bloody annoying spy monitors into scrap. There's ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) out there and nobody's been able to find the stupid things either since they barely put out a sig while they're collecting data. \n\nAnyway, the entire situation has been particularly frustrating for the ~mission(Contractor|Name), which is why they're paying for someone to scan the area and eliminate the threat. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)One last thing, they're rigged to dump their data when they're shot, so kill 'em quick.
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0004=Not sure if you've heard the rumors but arrests have spiked around ~mission(Location). security's showing up at jobs and sweeping everybody to the clink. Weren't dumb luck either. Cru-Sec was waiting for them. So, I did a little recon and discovered ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) surveilling the area. Plenty of people, including the ~mission(Contractor|Name), want this inconvenience eliminated. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\nI can guarantee good creds and my eternal gratitude if you do it. Hunt down the PDC Monitors by scanning for wherever they're hiding, and attack hard and fast before they get a chance to upload any data they've collected. Once they're gone, we can all get back to good, ol' fashioned criminalizing. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0005=You been by ~mission(Location) recently? ~mission(Contractor|Name) told me that security set up ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on anyone passing by. I'm not against a little law and order, that's what makes the game the game, but this goes too far. Let's just say that I'm not the only one who shares this sentiment. ~mission(Contractor|Name) are even paying to restore the balance. \n\nThese PDC Monitors are a pain to find so you'll need to scan the area. Plus, when you engage, you'll need to destroy them before they finish uploading all the dirt they've scraped up. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0006=Security thinks they're so smart. They set up ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) near ~mission(Location) to gather intel on the ~mission(Contractor|Name). Didn't take long before someone figured it out. So, feel like getting paid to literally blow up their stupid scheme? All you got to do is be the one to actually scan the area to find where the PDC Monitors are hiding and take 'em out. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)Another thing to keep in mind, these things are wired to protect the info they're pulling, so once you shoot, you gotta destroy them all before they can upload all their data.

As such, authorization has been given to enlist private contractors to help eliminate these devices.  You'll need to carefully scan the area once you arrive to identify the exact location of the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount). Since they passively skim information, they can be tricky to find.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nWord of warning, outlaws tend to rig these PDC Monitors with defensive protocols to automatically back up the data when attacked, so once you start shooting, you'll need to destroy them all quickly before the transfer can finish.
destroyprobelegal_desc_0002=Independent combat operators are needed to eliminate unauthorized surveillance monitors placed around ~mission(Location|Address). According to the initial report, ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has identified ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) intercepting data. Scanning the area for their location might be difficult since they have such low EM signatures, but they must be found and destroyed before sensitive intel is leaked. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These 'skimmers' are outfitted with data security protocols. They will begin transferring the data they've gathered when threatened, so operators will need to destroy them before the upload is allowed to complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0003=We've received reports that criminal elements have installed ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to spy on the area. Thankfully, we've finally been given the green light to hire combat operators to attack and destroy these systems. That's where you come in. \n\nYou will need to scan the area to find the PDC Monitors' location before the data illicitly gathered can be uploaded. The 'skimmers' will be in their passive data collection mode when you arrive making the search for them difficult, but know that once attacked, they will begin transmitting the contents of their drives. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0004=We are looking for experienced combat pilots to assist in the destruction of illegal surveillance systems that have been appearing in the sector. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw 'skimmers' have contributed to the deaths of security personnel as well as civilians by providing local criminals with intel about security movements and deployments. \n\nYou will be tasked with scanning the area around ~mission(Location|Address) where ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has indicated that you'll find ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) in operation. They will be well hidden thanks to their minimal power output. However, once engaged, these monitors will cease being covert and begin to upload their contents. You must destroy them before they complete the transfer otherwise highly sensitive data may be lost. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0005=Outlaw groups have been using ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on security forces by skimming data transmitted to and from ~mission(Location|Address). We are now actively seeking combat pilots to find and destroy these unauthorized 'skimmers.' ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)Know that it'll be difficult to hunt for their exact location since the monitors are design to only emit the barest of signatures and you may need to perform a thorough scan of the area. \n\nYou are to travel to the area, locate and then destroy all outlaw devices before any more innocent lives are lost. These PDC Monitors are outfitted with a failsafe program that will upload all data when attacked, so you will need to act before this process can complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0006=Combat pilots wanted to track and destroy unauthorized surveillance monitors. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw PDC monitors are a threat to public safety and must be eliminated.

dfm_ui_Boosting=To overpower your ship's maneuvering thrusters hold [~action(spaceship_movement|v_boost)]. This will increase your acceleration, but once your ship reaches its top speed the effect of Boost will be negligible.\nBoosting also helps you perform sharp turns by overpowering your maneuvering thrusters to help you achieve a tighter turn.\nYour ship can store a limited amount of the fuel which is used up while Boosting though this does replenish as gases are collected during normal flight.\nIt is important that you bear this in mind and use Boost only in the situations it will make most difference.

dfm_ui_Comstab=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can cycle the various safeties on and off by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_safeties)].
dfm_ui_Comstab_Pad=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can toggle COMSTAB by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_comstab)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures=When a missile is locked on your ship or an enemy is trying to achieve missile lock, you can attempt to break lock by using a countermeasure.\nTo fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Cont=\nCountermeasures are designed to disrupt specific types of missiles lock.\n~icon(Flare|22|22) The Decoy produces an intense burst of heat in an attempt to lure any pursuing heat-seeking missiles away from your ship. Decoys burn out quickly so missiles may reacquire lock-on if you fire on too early.\n~icon(Chaff|22|22) The Noise explodes into an expanding cloud of tiny filaments designed to confuse radar systems and break the lock of missiles with an electromagnetic lock-on system.\nYou can cycle the type of countermeasure armed by pressing [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_cycle_countermeasure_fwd)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Reminder=To fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].
dfm_ui_DecoupledMode=Pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_vector_decoupling)] will disable your main thruster allowing your ship to rotate freely with maneuvering thrusters whilst maintaining its current momentum and trajectory.\nYou can employ this technique if you have an enemy on your tail and wish to engage them without having to outmaneuver them first, but be aware that travelling through space facing the opposite direction is a dangerous tactic.
dfm_ui_Ejection=In the event of your ship taking critical damage it may be necessary to eject in order to save your life. You can do this by pressing [~action(spaceship_general|v_eject)].\nAlthough you may have cheated death in the short term, you will be left to contend with the dangers of space itself.
dfm_ui_FiringWeapons=To fire weapon group 1 hold [~action(spaceship_weapons|v_attack1_group1)], to fire weapon group 2 hold [~action(spaceship_weapons|v_attack1_group2)].\nOn your training ship group 1 is a ballistic weapon and group 2 is a pair of energy weapons.
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Advanced=Changing flight modes is context sensitive.\nWhen in Precision pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_mode_shift)] will change the mode up to SCM.\nIn SCM pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_mode_shift)] while travelling less than 50 m/s will change the mode down to Precision, while pressing when over 50m/s will change the mode up to Cruise.\nFinally, while in Cruise pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_mode_shift)] will change the mode down to SCM.\n<flight mode="" button=""></flight>
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Advanced_Reminder=Change your flight mode up from Precision to SCM by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_mode_shift)].
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Mouse=When using a mouse your view will be locked as this controls the steering of your ship. You can toggle Freelook by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)] to look around your cockpit.\nBe aware, whilst Freelook is active you will be unable to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Mouse_Reminder=Freelook can be toggled by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)]. While Freelook is enabled you will not be able to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Other=To look around your cockpit, push [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_aim_yaw)] in the direction you want to look. After a short time without input, your view will be reset to the center.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Pad=When using the Game Pad's right stick your view will be locked as the right stick primarily controls the steering of your ship. You can toggle Freelook by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)] to allow the right stick to look around your cockpit.\nBe aware, whilst Freelook is active you will be unable to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Pad_Reminder=Freelook can be toggled by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)]. While Freelook is enabled you will not be able to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_G-safe=G-safe is a safety feature which prevents you from performing maneuvers which would put your body through dangerous amounts of g-force by limiting the turn rate of your ship at high velocities.\nCaution, Boosting will override G-safe for the duration.\nWith G-safe disabled you will be able to pull off much tighter turns, but these put more stress on your body and possibly lead to loss of consciousness.\nYou can cycle the various safeties on and off by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_safeties)].
dfm_ui_G-safe_Pad=G-safe is a safety feature which prevents you from performing maneuvers which would put your body through dangerous amounts of g-force by limiting the turn rate of your ship at high velocities.\nCaution, Boosting will override G-safe for the duration.\nWith G-safe disabled you will be able to pull off much tighter turns, but these put more stress on your body and possibly lead to loss of consciousness.\nYou can toggle G-safe by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_gforce_safety)].
dfm_ui_Interaction=When you are within range and looking in the direction of an interactable object a prompt will appear on screen.\nTo interact with the object press [~action(player|use)] while the prompt is on screen.
dfm_ui_Landing=To toggle your ship's Landing System on and off press [~action(spaceship_movement|v_toggle_landing_system)]. Once engaged, any available landing zones within radar range will display as radar contacts with the nearest automatically becoming focused.\nBe aware that engaging the Landing System disables your combat targeting systems meaning you will lose the ability to lock and fire missiles.
dfm_ui_LandingModes=With the Landing System enabled there are two modes in which you can land.\nYou will begin in Manual Mode. To automate the landing procedure, engage the Automated Mode with [~action(spaceship_movement|v_cycle_landing_mode)] and fly over the landing zone. This will catch you and set you down safely, though not as quickly as if you were to master a manual landing.
dfm_ui_Landing_Cont=To cycle through the available landing zones press [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_target_cycle_friendly_fwd)] or to focus on the nearest press [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_target_nearest_hostile)].
dfm_ui_MatchSpeed=When behind a target you can match their speed by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_target_match_vel)].\nThis allows you to pursue a target without worrying about overshooting or collision if it decelerates suddenly.
dfm_ui_MissileFiring=Once you have achieved missile lock, hold [~action(spaceship_missiles|v_weapon_launch_missile)] to fire all of the missiles locked.
dfm_ui_MissileFiring_Reminder=To lock a missile press [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_target_missile_lock_focused)].\n To fire locked missiles hold [~action(spaceship_missiles|v_weapon_launch_missile)].
dfm_ui_MissileLocking=You can only lock missiles on the focus of your targeting system. Different missiles have different lock-on times and requirements, but as a general rule with the target in front of your ship press [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_target_missile_lock_focused)] to begin acquiring lock-on. The enemy ship will receive a warning tone to signal that a ship is attempting to lock on.\nIt is possible to lock multiple missiles onto a single target. You can do this by pressing [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_target_missile_lock_focused)] multiple times. The type and amount of missiles stacked will be shown beside the targeted ship.
dfm_ui_Movement_Mouse=When on foot hold [~action(player|moveforward)] to walk forward, [~action(player|moveback)] to walk backward, [~action(player|moveleft)] to walk left and [~action(player|moveright)] to walk right.
dfm_ui_Movement_Pad=When on foot push [~action(player|xi_movey)] in the direction you want to walk.
dfm_ui_OverviewPane=The OVR pane gives you a general overview of the status of the items attached to your ship's hardpoints. You can quickly toggle items on and off in this view.\nThis is the default information pane displayed, but can be accessed by pressing [~action(spaceship_hud|v_hud_open_tab1)].
dfm_ui_PowerPane=The PWR pane gives you the ability to alter your ship's total power distribution as well as distribution to individual components and groups.\nReducing your Power Throttle will reduce power to all components at the same time, shutting them down as their power allocation falls below the minimum necessary to function. Reducing overall power usage will drastically reduce your electromagnetic signature, but leave you vulnerable.\nThe power allocation triangle allows you to quickly distribute power to specific groups on your ship (generally these are set to G1 for weapons, G2 for shields and G3 for engines, but can be user-defined). To reset the power allocation triangle you will need to hold down [~action(spaceship_power|v_power_reset_focus)].\nThis pane can be accessed by pressing [~action(spaceship_hud|v_hud_open_tab3)].
dfm_ui_Press_x_ToRetry=Press [~action(default|retry)] to retry
dfm_ui_RearViewCamera=To access your ship's rear view camera hold [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_look_behind)].
dfm_ui_ReloadButtonPrompt=Tap [~action(player|reload)] to reload your weapon
dfm_ui_RequestingPermission=Some landing zones require you to request permission to land. To request permission on the selected zone, press [~action(spaceship_movement|v_landing_target_lock)]. If permission is granted, that zone will be assigned to you, preventing other ships requesting the same landing zone and your radar will be replaced with the landing helper which will guide you to the zone and provide feedback on your progress.
dfm_ui_Rolling_Mouse=You are able to roll your ship left by holding [~action(spaceship_movement|v_roll_left)] and right by holding [~action(spaceship_movement|v_roll_right)].
dfm_ui_Rolling_Mouse_Reminder=To perform an axial roll hold [~action(spaceship_movement|v_roll_left)] or [~action(spaceship_movement|v_roll_right)] until you have rotated your ship through 360 degrees.
dfm_ui_Rolling_Other=You are able to roll your ship by holding [~action(spaceship_movement|v_roll)].
dfm_ui_Rolling_Other_Reminder=To perform an axial roll hold [~action(spaceship_movement|v_roll)] until you have rotated your ship through 360 degrees.
dfm_ui_Self-destruct=Initiating your ship's Self-destruct sequence should be a final resort.

distraction_desc_0001=Put down whatever you're doing and pay attention. This is a big one.\n\nThe ~mission(Client) got a massive score cooking, but in order to pull it off, they need an equally massive distraction. \n\nThat's you.\n \nYou're gonna head over to a ~mission(Location) and start nuking everything and everyone you can. ~mission(Wanted)You'll be making so much noise, no one will even care what the ~mission(Client) are up to.
distraction_desc_0002=You ever dream about flying out to some remote ~mission(Location) and shooting everything that moves? Well, guess what? I'm here to make your dreams come true. And not only that, I'm gonna pay you for it.\n\nI can't tell you all the specifics, but the upshot is that the ~mission(Client) are eager to make sure all the security in sector are kept as busy as possible.\n\nNow, it seemed to me that sending someone to rampage at the ~mission(Location) would be a damn good start. ~mission(Wanted)Shouldn't be too hard to keep everyone's attention after that.
distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(Client) are looking to pay good credits for someone to create a distraction for them. And since I can't figure out how to lure a Vanduul fleet to the sector, a cutthroat like you flying to a ~mission(Location) and unleashing hell might be the next best thing. ~mission(Wanted)\n\nCan you believe some people choose to work in an office for a living?
distraction_desc_0004=Hey. Did you ever hear about the system-wide hunt in Ellis for that slicer a little while back? Advocacy were running in circles for days trying to take them down. Got me thinking. The ~mission(Client) are going after a huge score soon and then I thought, why not just arrange for something similar to happen here? Get all the security in the area chasing after a target so that they're blind to whatever else is going on. It would make the ~mission(Client) job a billion times easier. \n\nHere's how it'll work. You fly to a ~mission(Location) and unleash some major chaos and destruction. They already patrol places like that pretty heavily so you should have company in no time flat. ~mission(Wanted)To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if that thing in Ellis wasn't just a distraction, too.

Normally, I'd be telling you to keep your head down and till the heat blows over, but it just so happens that I got a better use for you.\n\nI've been working on something big that's ready to go down, but in order to make it happen I need someone to create a distraction that's even bigger. That's where you come in. \n\nThe way I figure it, if you take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy humps, just about every screw in the entire Empire will be focused on dragging your ass down. \n\nCan't be lower sec either. Needs to be Navy to really pull this off. That's fine though, any security gets wind of a level 5 and they'll comm the Navy to come deal with you.\n\nAnd you have to do it fast enough so that the timing works out. As soon as you open fire on the first one, the clock starts.\n\nThink you can handle that?
distractionkill_desc_0002=I'll be honest with you, I usually don't like to deal with your kind of crazy, but a mad dog is exactly what I need right now. \n\nMy crew and I need all the security in the system kept busy for a while and the only way I see that happening is if you bring down enough Navy that they don't have a choice but to stop everything and focus on you. I think about ~mission(KillCount) starmen should do it. \n\nLucky thing is, with your level 5, they should be chasing you anyway. Security stops to scan you and the Navy's gonna come straight to you. Just make sure that once you start shooting that you finish the job. As soon as you engage with the first one, the clock starts and if you don't raise the stakes high enough, me and my crew are gonna be left hanging.\n\nOf course, feel free to kill even more of the bastards if the mood takes you.
distractionkill_desc_0003=Word on the wire is that every flattop with a badge is out there scanning the system for your level 5 wanted ass. What do you say to making some credits off all that hassle?\n\nI can't tell you exactly what's going down, but it's enough for you to know that I need a cataclysmic level distraction. The kind that can only be created by a dangerous and deranged criminal going on a shooting spree and taking out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen. \n\nOnce you start shooting, my crew will move into place, so you'll have to finish the job quick. And Navy only. Popping off some Advos or local security won't cut it. Fortunately, with your crimestat anytime you run into security, Navy shouldn't be far behind.\n\nGet this done for me, and I'll see that you get your fair cut.

hdactivist_assassination_desc_001=To anyone who knows Hurston's recent history, they know that ~mission(TargetName) is responsible for some truly vicious crimes against the honest men and women who are trying to improve worker conditions on Hurston. Time and time again, they have acted well outside the bounds of UEE law but, of course, Hurston denies that ~mission(TargetName|Last) has anything to do with these crimes and refuses to even investigate them. This miscarriage of justice means that we must take matters into our own hands. \n\nRecently, an insider sympathetic to our cause says ~mission(TargetName|Last) can be found around ~mission(Location|Address). I will happily pass along this information, and a substantial payday, to anyone willing to bring vengeance upon them. ~mission(Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_002=Any chance you've heard of ~mission(TargetName)? Hurston recently promoted this bloodthirsty thug to a special task force that makes dissidents disappear. ~mission(TargetName|Last) has proven to be quite effective and even taken a perverse pleasure in the new position. It's obvious that the universe would be better off if ~mission(TargetName|Last) was taken down.\n\n~mission(Danger)I managed to get a hold of their latest deployment orders. You should be able to find them at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_003=Let's just say the less you know about this one the better.

hdactivist_assassination_timed_003=There's chatter that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is planning something big. You've got to stop them before it's too late. 
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_001=Recently, Hurston security forces have been increasingly more violent to anyone voicing opposition to their authority. We've tried all legal channels, but it seems that an equally aggressive response will be the only way they'll hear us. I'm looking to pay someone to deliver that message.\n\nWe've learned that security forces have been operating out of ~mission(Location|Address). I'll send you the coordinates. You go in and clear it out. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger)\n\nHopefully there will be a day where we can resolve this through rational discourse, but they've made it clear that it is not today.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_002=Looking for a heavy hitter interested in some serious action. ~mission(Location|Address) is crawling with corrupt, armed assholes working for Hurston.

hdactivist_basesweep_desc_003=If you found this, it's probably safe to say that you have an axe to grind with Hurston. I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of waiting for things to magically get better. What we need are bold actions to show Hurston that the status quo must go. \n\nThat's why I dug up some info about ~mission(Location|Address). It's where corporate thugs hang out and plan their attacks on the people of Hurston. Clearing that location would send a bold message to Corporate that we're willing to fight fire with fire. You interested? \n\nIt'll be dangerous, but you'll be paid well. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_004=We got intel on ~mission(Location|Address) that says it's staffed with corporate thugs. We aren't just going to sit around and wait for them to crack down on our brothers and sisters who are just trying to make Hurston a better place to live. I don't have the skills to handle this type of op, but I've got the creds to fund it. Interested? \n\nShould go without saying, but this job will be highly dangerous. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep)A lot of good people will get hurt if someone doesn't stop them.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_005=Looking for someone who's willing to fight for what's right. For far too long Hurston has used violence to keep its people in line. Now it's time to show them that their intimidation tactics won't go unanswered.\n\nI've recently obtained intel that's identified ~mission(Location|Address) as being key to their security operations. Anyone willing to clear out the location will be doing the people of Hurston a great service.

mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_001=A tremendous opportunity seems to have landed... well crashed in our favor. A Hurston satellite has quite ungracefully plummeted to the surface. Thankfully, it appears that a ~mission(Item) has miraculously survived the incident.\n\nNow, I know that there are plenty of Hurston's rivals who would be... eager... to get an advance look at this tech. I'm sure I could convince them to pay handsomely for an opportunity like this, but I'll need you to retrieve it. You can start your search at the ~mission(Location) and work out from there. \n\nOnce recovered, you will only have a short time to upload the information from the ~mission(Item) using the decryption software on a designated Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. Your best bet will be to access a data center inside one of the storage facilities that dot the surface of the planet. They typically have minimal security so I don't foresee you running into any issues. \n\nNeedless to say, I will pay you handsomely upon completion and we can both bask in knowledge that Hurston has been hit where it hurts.\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_002=I managed to intercept an interesting bit of news coming over the comms. It seems Hurston's fortunes are falling quite literally; one of their satellites has crashed to the surface. Not all is lost however, for the valuable ~mission(Item) onboard appears to have survived the impact.  \n\nNow, this is one of those moments where enterprising individuals face a choice. Either do nothing, let Hurston reclaim their property and let this wretched world keep turning or seize the opportunity to capitalize. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter and I'm hoping you feel the same. \n\nIf you were to obtain the part from the ~mission(location) before Hurston does, I'm sure I could find some parties interested in paying handsomely for a sneak peek at Hurston's hard work.\n\nOne catch (as always), is that in order to safely decrypt and extract the data, you must connect it to an official Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. I recommend using a storage facilities data terminal. They tend to be easier to access than anything that can be found in Lorville proper. Once the transfer is complete, I will issue your just rewards.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_003=My Dear Compatriot,\n\nWonderful tidings. It seems that we have received an unexpected but most welcomed guest - a Hurston satellite has been ejected from orbit and crashed practically straight into our laps. Most importantly, the ~mission(Item) onboard has survived intact.  \n\nNow, it just so happens that this cutting-edge Prototype has been long desired by some deep-pocketed associates of mine. If you were able to acquire this wayward Blade from the ~mission(Location) before Hurston manages to do so, I could ensure significant restitution for your time and troubles.\n\nThe only real wrinkle is that the information on the Prototype is inaccessible (and will self-destruct) unless connected to an official Hurston server. Fortunately, there is access to the said server dotted around the planet inside Hurston Storage Facilities. It should be short work for you to get the Blade and then take it to the server for decryption and extraction. Once the data transfer is finished, I will happily transfer the well-earned credits into your account. \n\nSafe travels,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)

mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_01=UPDATE: Looks like someone has beaten us to the punch. We cannot allow some second rate hoods sell the data. My reputation would be devastated.

If you restart the satellite's main internal control system, it should reactivate the ~mission(Item) and allow you to identify its current status.
mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_02=UPDATE: It seems we were not the only ones eager to abscond with the blade. Can you imagine the impertinence of poaching in my territory? If word gets out, the implications could be ruinous. It cannot stand. The only option is for you to stop the decryption before they can complete their sale.\n\nTo track down the current location of the ~mission(Item), restart the satellite's main internal control system. It should activate the tracking protocol and allow you to find the culprits responsible.
mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_03=UPDATE: It seems Hurston Security's much more competent than I thought. They've identified your location and are sending mercenaries to your position as we speak. Protect the ~mission(Item) until the transfer is complete. Otherwise, all of this will be for naught.
mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_04=UPDATE: Unfortunate news. Hurston Security has gotten word of our little pilfering ploy and their ruthless thugs are hunting you down at this very moment.

This particular incident happened aboard a ~mission(ship), so I'll need you to go out to ~mission(location) and pull the ~mission(item).

mg_pacheco_DestroyEvidence_desc_001=It turns out that security over at ~mission(location|address) got their hands on a box of evidence that shouldn’t exist. I’m gonna pay you to destroy it for me.\n\nGetting to the evidence won’t be a walk in the park. You’ll have to make it past the station’s turrets and heavy security, and then take out the Chief of Security in order to get their access code to the Evidence Storage Unit. And even that’s not straightforward since the Chief only deals with high-level emergencies so I’m thinking you’ll have to shoot up the place pretty good before they feel it’s worth showing up. Bringing a crew with you and approaching the station carefully is probably a good idea.\n\nOnce the Evidence Inventory System is started up, the box I want should be easy to find - it's blue and has "EVIDENCE" written on it. Destroy that and I’ll get you paid.\n\nWhat you do after that is up to you. There’s probably plenty of other valuable crap locked up in the Evidence Storage if you’re willing to hang around long enough to grab it, but that’s on you.\n\n-Twitch\n
mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_001=Long story short, one of my people got pinched with some evidence that could make things very uncomfortable for me and some of my associates. That’s why I want you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal it for me.\n\nIt won’t be easy. Not only is the station protected by turrets and crawling with security, but the access code to activate the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. In order to get to them, you’ll need to create enough havoc to force the Chief to come deal with you in person. I usually don’t like loud and messy, but this job calls for it. It wouldn't be a bad idea to approach the station carefully and bring a crew along to help.\n\nOn the bright side, the evidence I want should be easy to spot. The box is blue and says "EVIDENCE" on the side. Anything else you want to take from storage and sell is fine with me as long as you remember that I’m your priority. \n\nOnce you have my evidence, drop it off at ~mission(destination|address) and we can call it a day.\n\n-Twitch\n
mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_002=I'll spare you the details, but I need a bit of leverage in a tricky negotiation and know exactly where to get it. That’s why I’m sending you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal a box of evidence for me.\n \nNow, I won’t lie to you. The job’s a toughy. The station is thick with turrets and security, and the only access code to the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. To make things worse, that snotty bastard doesn’t like to get their hands dirty unless it’s a full-blown emergency which means that you’ll have to escalate things before the Chief will even bother coming round.\n\nOnce you do activate the Evidence Inventory System, the box I want should be the first one out. Now, there might be more boxes coming out after it, you can consider those your bonus payment. \n\nJust be sure that you take care of dropping off my evidence at ~mission(destination|address) first and foremost.\n\nI figure if you approach the station carefully and bring the right crew along, we should all be able to get what we want. \n\n-Twitch\n

All have been loyal and deserve better than rotting in jail.\n\nAt least I think they've been loyal... I'm still wondering how they got pinched in the first place.

mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0001=Word is that security are gonna hit a stash house known as ~mission(Location) that some scabbers are using to store a treasure trove of narcotics. Among their supply, they've managed to snag a particular package of Maze. Seems like they're trying to up their station in the world.\n\nPrice of Maze on the street is skyrocketing... which is weird. Stuff just looks like wood chips to me. Anyway, I've gotten word that BlacJac's been tipped off to this little operation, so let's just say, this presents us with a unique opportunity. I know when the raid's going to start, so I want you to hit the stash before they show up and bring the Maze back. \n\nYou'll need a ship that can haul at least one box, but feel free to use something bigger. Anything else in the facility is up for grabs if you want to bother lifting it. Just be sure to deliver our Maze to ~mission(Destination) and we'll be square. Copy? \n\nIf you run into any resistance, I'll trust you'll deal with it, but the Maze is the real prize here.\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0002=Some of our competition over at ~mission(Location) is about to run into massive load of bad luck. BlacJac's caught wind of their stash house and are posting up to raid it.\n\nI've managed to find out exactly when they're going to hit the stash house, but I want you to hit it first. I imagine that the crew that's operating the stash won't be too enthusiastic about you robbing their supply, so if you run into any opposition, handle it.\n\nI want you to go in and steal their supply of Maze before security destroys it. Like I said, there's a bunch of drugs in there, but lucky for you Maze just looks like pieces of tree bark which should make it stand out. If you bring a ship that can hold enough cargo, you're welcome to help yourself to any of the other drugs in there. \n\nJust make sure that you can at least haul out the one box of Maze we're paying you for over to ~mission(Destination).\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0003=There's this little corner of heaven called ~mission(Location) that some of the local scumbags use to hand off drug shipments. You ever hear of it? \n\nWell, as of a few hours ago, a source told me that they were moving a package of Maze through there. I'm not sure if you've ever danced with that stuff before, but it looks like bits of bark.\n\nMy employers want it, but for whatever reason, they aren't willing to declare open war on this group. Apparently they're protected by somebody. Anyway, I tipped off BlacJac about the stash and they're getting ready to raid it. \n\nI want you to go in and secure the Maze before the place gets burned. Odds are this stash is gonna be guarded, so make sure you break some weapons. If you want to help yourself to anything else in there, that's on you to bring a ship big enough to haul it out. But at the very least bring a ship that can handle carting off the one box of Maze that's ours to ~mission(Destination). \n\nDon't worry about clearing out scavs you find there, either. Unless they get in your way that is. Thankfully, BlacJac'll get blamed for whatever body count gets left behind.\n\n-Twitch

mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Oh hello, I recently overheard a little bit of intel that ~mission(location|address) received some confidential materials that are of great interest to an acquaintance of mine. So interesting that they’re willing to pay for someone to storm the facility, grab the goods, and deliver them to ~mission(DropOff1|address). Now I expect there to be plenty of security, who will most likely put up a fight, so I’d bring a gun or two. \n\nWord is the confidential materials were delivered in a consignment alongside other stuff and are now being stored in the facility’s automated vault. Senior security officers on-site carry datapads containing retrieval codes used to access the vault. You’ll have to get your hands on a datapad before using the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nIf you need a little sweetener, I’ve seen the manifest and can confirm that the other crates being stored at the facility are pretty choice. My client could care less about what happens to them, so they’re yours to do as you please. Run this right and those extra crates could be a nice bonus on top of the delivery fee for you.
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_E_desc_001=Seems there’s a new upstart in the sector who hasn’t been paying the right dues to the right people. To teach them a little lesson, my client wants you to go down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site.\n\nThe low-level lugs they got on site will probably make a stink about it and try to stop you. Handle them however you want but getting rid of the product is the most important thing.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_H_desc_001=A client of mine‘s trying to negotiate a deal, but isn’t having much luck. The other party feels like they got all the leverage because they’re sitting comfortably on a pile of inventory. To help move the negotiations along, I’m gonna need you to head down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site. \n\nNow, I should probably tell you that the site’s being protected by some very serious people, so getting to the stash is going to be a bit tricky, but I trust you’ll find a way. \n
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_desc_001=One of my clients has been unhappy to learn that someone's been muscling in on their territory. Now rather than going down the more traditional route of killing some people and starting a whole thing, they’ve opted to send a different kind of message instead.\n\nYou’re gonna go down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site. \n\nOf course, if someone does wanna pick a fight with you, feel free to defend yourself, but getting rid of the product is the most important thing.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_allies_desc_001=One of my clients is planning a hostile takeover of a rival at ~mission(Location|Address), but word got out, and now they’re worried they’re not going to have enough fire power to see it through.\n\nI figured you would be the perfect addition to tip the scale in their favor and help my client’s people wipe out this other gang.\n\nThis last part is important though – they don’t want any workers hurt. They’re hoping to be able to start production again almost immediately and don’t want to bother with hiring new staff. Got that? Kill goons with guns, don’t kill workers.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_civsonly_desc_001=A client is getting out produced by a new competitor and is looking to throw a wrench into the works.\n\nYou’re going to head to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill all the civies who work there. \n\nDo what you want with the gun-toting goons guarding the workers, but remember that they aren’t the priority.  \n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_desc_001=This is a bit aggressive for my taste, but credits are credits, right?\n\nGot a client who's looking for a highly motivated individual to head over to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill everyone who’s there. \n\nBasically, start shooting and don’t stop. You'll get paid once the site's clear.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_nocivs_desc_001=I know someone who’s looking to start up a new business, but they’re having a hard time hiring the skilled workers they need.\n\nNow the thing is, they found the perfect crew over at ~mission(Location|Address), but the people they work for won’t let them go. Even hired extra armed guards to make sure of it.\n\nWhat I want you to do, is go there and kill all the guards while making sure all the workers remain unharmed. \n
mg_ruto_UGF_steal_desc_001=This one should be a ringer for somebody like you. There’s a package being held at ~mission(Location|Address) and I need you to bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nThere's one super tiny issue that you should know about. There’s gonna be a crap ton of security down there. But I'm sure it should be fine.\n\n:)
mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0003=And so you know, you won't be the first person who's gone after ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst). People think that they're a little bulletproof. Might take a few shots to keep 'em down.

mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0003=~mission(TargetName) is a ghost. Problem is, no one's told them they're dead yet.

mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0004=A piece of trash that goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName) just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Need you to put them down. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Last piece of advice - don't try to talk to them first or anything weird. Just do the job.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0005=Long story short, ~mission(TargetName) screwed over the ~mission(Client) and as it turns out, it's going to be the last thing they ever do. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) A friend of the ~mission(Client) spotted them near ~mission(Location) so I'd suggest starting there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) You find them, you put them down.

mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0002=~mission(rush)You gotta head out to the wreck of a ~mission(ship), pull a ~mission(item), and run it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)~mission(client) will transfer your money when they get confirmation it's done.
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0003=Not sure if you heard, but a ~mission(ship) got wasted recently in sys.

I'll hook you up with the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)Once you get the ~mission(item), you run it over to ~mission(destination) where they'll scrub it. That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0004=Got a client who came asking about a ~mission(ship) that went down recently. They're very interested in someone retrieving the ~mission(item) and taking it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)Of course, they're willing to pay for this. ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0005=Got a straight boost job here. You go out to the ~mission(ship)'s wreck and pull the ~mission(item).

mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0002=Look, no one likes being monitored while they work, right? So all we're going to do is take down Array ~mission(CommArray) for a little while while some people do some work. ~mission(rush)We don't need to get into who's doing what or any of the other details, the important thing is that once it's offline, some credits are going to find their way into your account courtesy of some ~mission(gang). ~mission(Time)Sounds good, right? ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0003=I just got paid to manufacture a blackout. Which means that you can get paid for executing one. It's fairly simple, head over to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. ~mission(time)~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0004=I was contacted by some ~mission(gang) to provide a little privacy. Guess they have a job or something going down. Anyway, that's not for you. You are going to bring down CommArray ~mission(CommArray). ~mission(time)~mission(rush)Take it down and I'll pay you out. ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0005=So it seems somebody wants to make an area less secure. Shocking, right? As a struggling businessman in these tough economic times, I am uncomfortable with such a request, but I feel obligated to my clients. Customer service is very important to me. Anyway, you'll need to gain entry to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. Just an FYI, the ~mission(gang) who are putting up the creds for this are VIP, so make sure it's done right. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)

mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0001=A bit of backstory on this one. Some random scav has been going around claiming that they offed a big time hitter by the name of ~mission(TargetName). Claims that they caught ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) right in the middle of pulling a job. Now the thing is, if ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) is really dead... well... that creates complications for the ~mission(Client). \n\nAnyway, after some careful negotiations from yours truly, they've coughed up some creds to pay for someone to go out and verify that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is actually dead. ~mission(Timed)You will just need to go to ~mission(Location), find the body and confirm. ~mission(Danger) 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0002=Here's a bit of dreadful business to throw your way. ~mission(Client) had a recent op that apparently turned into a total shitshow. Mayhem and carnage to the nth degree. Anyway, the rumor was that ~mission(TargetName) got clipped in the exchange, but now people are saying that the bastard's still alive. \n\nAnyway, the ~mission(Client) need to know one way or the other. That's why I'm having you go out to ~mission(Location) and confirm that they're a corpsicle. Once you get the ID, you get paid. ~mission(Danger)Pretty simple, right? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0003=Everyone's been talking about ~mission(TargetName) recently. The ~mission(Client) have been saying that they were killed a few days ago in the middle of pulling a job for them, but... well, let's just say that they're a less than accurate source of information. Anyway, I've got a client who's eager to prove them wrong, so they're shelling out some creds to get a positive id on the body. I'll hook you up with the  ~mission(Location). You have a look and tell me if you find them. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0004=Got a simple, but kinda disgusting job here. In a recent raid, ~mission(TargetName)'s ticket got punched and I guess the ~mission(Client) want some proof of old ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s remains for... something. I honestly don't know why. Maybe they're worried that the bastard is playing dead just to steal from them. Anyway, they gave me the  ~mission(Location) and are paying for someone to go out and confirm the kill. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) hired a hitter to take out a rival who's been poaching on their turf, but between you and me, I guess they didn't really get their credits worth because the guy forgot to provide proof that ~mission(TargetName) was actually dead. Anyway, I told them I could provide that, and by that, I mean you could provide it. All you gotta do is go to  ~mission(Location) and confirm that ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s touching void. ~mission(Danger)Once I get confirmation, you get paid. ~mission(Timed)

mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0001=This one's gonna be a little tricky. The ~mission(Client) need someone to set up a ~mission(Item) so they can eavesdrop on the local suckers. You have to pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location), set the thing up at ~mission(Destination) and get out. ~mission(Danger)Once it's up and running, you'll get your creds.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0002=Need someone to set up a snooping device for the ~mission(Client) and they're gonna pay well to make it happen. First you'll need to pick up a ~mission(Item). I think they got one set aside over at ~mission(Location). Anyway, whenever you've got one, make your way over to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)You gotta set it up at the right spot or it won't work. Once the thing's running, get the hell out of there. Creds will be waiting when you're clear.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0003=~mission(Client) are paying for someone to drop a ~mission(Item) over at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)Pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location) and get to it.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0004=You ever work with a ~mission(Item)? It's fairly simple stuff. Take it to an area, turn the thing on, and it taps into nearby comms. Nice little system if you're looking to dig up a little intel, maybe scout out a couple marks to hit. Anyway, I need one dropped at ~mission(Destination) for this thing I'm looking into and I need you to set it up. ~mission(Danger)Head over to ~mission(Location) and pick it up, they got one set aside for you. I'll transfer the credits once you got it active.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0005=I guess the ~mission(Client) are cooking up something big. They've requested a ~mission(Item) get set up over at ~mission(Destination). You'll need to grab one from ~mission(Location), head over and set it up. They're pretty self-explanatory, so don't sweat the set up. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnyway, once you got the ~mission(Item) in place and active, get the hell out of there. I'll pay you after.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0006=Got client who's looking to put some ears on ~mission(Destination). All you gotta do is head over to ~mission(Location), pick up a ~mission(Item) then go set it up. ~mission(Danger)Job ain't over until the ~mission(Item)'s up and running, so make sure it's safe and operational. Once they get the data stream, you get the creds. Simple, right?

mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0001=I have to say, this might be one of the best plans I've ever come up with. See, the ~mission(client) are looking to pull off the job of the century, but no way they'd get away clean. That is of course, unless there's something even bigger going down at the same time. You're gonna be the something bigger. I'm talking chaos on a whole new scale. \n\n~mission(wanted)With that nasty of a reputation, all you have to do is go visit a ~mission(Location) in the area and shoot at everything that shows up. I'll even tip off the authorities so they know exactly where you are. I figure with all the noise you'll be making, no way anyone gives two shits about what the ~mission(client) are up to.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0002=This is the sort of job most scavers only dream about getting paid for. How often do you get paid to make as big of a mess as you can?\n\n~mission(wanted)Between the bounty on your head, and me telling everyone where to find you, you should have about every ship in the sector on your ass in seconds. I figure we'll have you make your stand at a ~mission(Location) and I'll make sure word gets out on where to find you. Then all you have to do is keep them occupied for as long as you can. \n\nOf course, you're probably wondering why you're doing all this. While I can't tell you the details, let's just say that the ~mission(client) are going to be very appreciative for you keeping all the security forces occupied.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) are gonna pay you to unleash as much hell as you can in the sector. ~mission(wanted)You show up at a ~mission(Location) guns blazing, I put the word out on the spec, and just like that, everybody is looking the other way while the real job is going down. Classic misdirection.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0004=You know how I normally want my people to keep a low profile? Well, not this time. The ~mission(client) need you to tie up every bit of law in the sector. Make them so busy they won't notice anything else going on. I'm talking next level destruction. ~mission(analogy)~mission(wanted)\n\nEven better is I'll tip off everyone before hand so they know exactly where to find you. I'm thinking a ~mission(Location) since those are usually patrolled to begin with. Then all that's left is for you to take down as many of the bastards as you can. Should make headlines on the spec for weeks.

mg_ruto_havejob_desc_0008=Have a gig that I'm thinking of bringing you in on. Could be a decent payday for everyone if it pans out. Why don't you come by ~mission(location) and we'll hash specifics.

mg_ruto_intromission_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0001=Hi there. I've been hearing your name pop up a lot recently on security channels. Seems you're pretty hell bent on making life difficult for those authority types. I'll be honest. I like that kind of initiative. I know some people who might be interested in subsidizing your anti-social habits. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI'd like to see how you operate in the field myself, so here's the deal, the ~mission(Client) have pushed someone into the sweet hereafter and have paid for someone to make the remains disappear. That's considerate, right? No sense letting trash like that stink up ~mission(Location01). Anyway, I'd like you to go there, collect the boxes and dispose of them. Don't really care where as long as it's off-world and not in front of some cops. Simple, right? Anyway, you do this and we can talk about further, more lucrative, employment opportunities. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0002=You're becoming quite popular among the unsavories. My name's Ruto. You've probably heard of me. I'm a sort of talent scout for unsavories myself and I'm pretty good at it, if I say so. Part of the reason for that is standards. Not a lot of people have 'em. Me, I need to know that when I give a job to one of my people, that they'll execute it. Otherwise, it's just chaos, you know? But the bad kind. \n\nAnyway, I think we might be able to help each other out. First though, I need to see you in action for myself. The ~mission(Client) ghosted some idiot down at ~mission(Location01) and need the packaged up remains disposed of. Feels like something you could handle, no? Knock this out and maybe we can talk more. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0003=Why hello. Been watching you for a while now. Not in a creepy way or anything, more like professional curiosity. See, I make it my business to know who's making moves in my system. If I see someone with potential, let's just say, I bring them into the fold. \n\nAnyway, I think you might be the kinda person I should know better. But first, I've got a little job for you. Something simple to show me that you're not one of these lazy kids I see on the spectrum. That you're a real go-getter. \n\nThere's remains of a body down at ~mission(Location01). I won't tell you who did it or why. Only that the boxes need to get gone. Take them off-world somewhere and dump it. You do that and maybe I can fill you in on all the exciting opportunities available to an entrepreneurial go-getter like yourself. ~mission(Timed)

mg_ruto_invite_desc_0002=Thanks for taking care of that little job for me. Hope it wasn't too messy. Anyway, as promised, I'd like to invite you down and see if we can't work out a little arrangement. If you're interested, head on over to Grim HEX. Somewhere in the back halls, you'll find a run down little hole called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0003=I think it's about time we talked about your future. Don't you think? You ever been to Grim HEX before? Nasty little corner of nothing in the field above Yela. Swing on by and look for a tech shop called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, we'll have a little chat about your future, yeah? See if we can help each other out.

mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0001=Normally people in our rarified profession don't mind working in the shadows, but having zero power is a bit much. It's even starting to hurt the operations down over at ~mission(Destination). See if you can go sort them out with a new battery, okay? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0002=A storm down surface side a little while back caused some damage and now ~mission(Destination) doesn't have any power at all. Can't really afford to have them down for long, so I need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0003=Some wingnut over at ~mission(Destination) tried fixing an electrical problem on their own and now the whole outpost doesn't have power. Got to love that DIY attitude. I'm having flashbacks to ~mission(DIY). ~mission(Timed)Anyway, do me a favor and run a battery down there.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0004=I'm hoping you have some maintenance experience, because I need someone to bring a replacement battery down to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)And if anyone's there when you show up, don't let them talk you into cleaning up or anything. The contract is just for the battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0005=Got word from ~mission(Destination) that they've gone dark. Not sure what the hell they're doing there, but this is like the fifth time they've lost power this month. Probably trying to run a hot tub or something off the gennie. Either way, gonna need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0001=There was an 'accident' and now there's a couple of boxes of remains where they shouldn't be. ~mission(Client) need a cleaner to cart them off-world. ~mission(Timed)And don't tell me what you do with them. It's probably better if I don't know.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0002=The ~mission(Client) had a change of leadership and their former manager's been made redundant right through the eyes. Now they need someone to "clear out the desk," so to speak, and dump everything off-world. ~mission(Timed)Really makes me appreciate being self-employed.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0003=Bit of a going away party / funeral that I want you to attend. The guest of honor needs a ride off-world and you're gonna give it to 'em. Dead bastard really should have known better than to skim from the ~mission(Client). ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0004=Guess there was a bit of a disagreement between a couple of ~mission(Client) that got pretty heated. Anyway, they need someone to escort whatever's left of the losing side off the premises. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0005=One of the big truths in this 'verse is that dead bodies seldom go anywhere on their own. That's why the ~mission(Client) need us to move one for them. I'm sure you can figure out somewhere suitably private to take the remains. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address). 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0002=The ~mission(Client) are a little on edge about the remains just sitting out there. I've told them there's nothing to worry about, but let's go ahead and take care of this as fast as possible. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0004=Gonna call this a rush job. Remain are not going anywhere, but the ~mission(Client) will feel a lot better once everything's been taken care of. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_title=~mission(Title)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0001=This is a simple delivery run. Pick up a box of ~mission(drug) from ~mission(location) and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0002=Short and sweet. You're gonna head to~mission(location) and pick up a shipment of ~mission(drug). Make sure you keep a low profile and run it to ~mission(destination)". Simple. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)One more thing. This is for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0003=Word's come down that the ~mission(client) need some product moved from ~mission(location) and delivered to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Hopefully I don't need to reiterate this, but don't even think about sampling the supply.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0004=Apparently there's been a high demand for ~mission(drug), so the ~mission(client) need to re-up their dealers. You're gonna head down to ~mission(location), pick up the package and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0005=Here you go. Like I said, it's a pretty straightforward job. ~mission(client) need some ~mission(drug) grabbed from ~mission(location) and taken to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)You do this right and not only will you stay in my good graces, you'll make some nice creds as well. Seems fair, right? ~mission(rush)

mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0003=We've been hired by the ~mission(client) to move some cargo. Now, they didn't tell me what's in the box and you're going to be paid not to care. All you gotta do is snag the ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) and get it to ~mission(destination) in one piece. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat) \n\nOh, do me a favor and don't look inside, okay? 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0004=As far as gigs go, they don't get much more basic than this. All you gotta do is go to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item). Once you got it, take it over to ~mission(destination) and dump it. That's it. Seriously. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0005=This is a a straight cargo run. The ~mission(item) needs to get from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)This is a job for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0006=Got a simple run for you. Well... it should be pretty simple. ~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) moved from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)Get the ~mission(item) there in one piece and you get paid. Like I said, simple.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location).

mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0001=Here's the deal. Some people I know have some ~mission(Item) that needs disposing of. I know. I know. Not exactly the type of work you dreamed of doing, but creds are creds, right? Times like these, people should be grateful for anything that comes their way. All you gotta do is pick up the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. Don't care where, but maybe not in front of some cops.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0002=Kind of a basic run. Not really worth your talents, but hey, a gig's a gig, right? All you gotta do is pick up some ~mission(Item) and get rid of it. That's it.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0003=Need you to swing by one of my clients and take away some ~mission(Item). They're paying to get it off-site and off-world, but don't care what happens after that, so neither do I. Do it and you'll get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0004=Looks like a friend needs some ~mission(Item) disposed of without any questions. Head there, grab the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. They don't come much simpler.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0005=Hope you don't mind getting your hands dirty. I'm serious. This isn't a metaphor. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to get dumped. Head on over and they should have it all boxed up and waiting for you to get off-world. One time contract. Standard pay.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0006=This here's a quick one. Shouldn't be too much trouble. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to disappear. Pick it up, dump it off, get paid.

mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0001=~mission(contractor) have gone ahead and started poking around somewhere they shouldn't. You're gonna make them stop. Head out to ~mission(location) and clear every last one of those advocacy-wannabes from along their patrol route. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0002=Seems ~mission(contractor) has started patrolling out over in ~mission(location) by some of the ~mission(client)' territory. They'd normally take care of it themselves but since they've got something bigger in the works that they'd rather not risk, decided to hire an outsider to sweep the area clear. ~mission(danger)Last thing, try not to let any of them escape. It's not really professional, you know?
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) have a score all lined up, but they can't do anything about because some over-achieving ~mission(contractor) lugs are patrolling ~mission(location). Need you to fly along the route and take out any security you find. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0004=I tried to warn them, but the ~mission(client) got overeager and now, thanks to them attacking too many civies, ~mission(contractor)'s stepping up patrols through ~mission(location). Gotten so bad they can't do business as long as security's there. That's where we come in. You're going to fly the patrol route and sweep it clean. ~mission(danger)Honestly though, I think you're gonna have a lot of fun with this one.
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0005=Despite the best efforts of myself and the other criminally-minded individuals in this sector, ~mission(contractor) is still trying to clean the place up. They even started patrolling out in ~mission(location). Can you believe it? There's no way we're gonna let that kind of initiative stand, so that's why you're going to fly along this patrol and clear them the hell out. ~mission(danger)

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0004=You know, looking at the ~mission(ship)'s position, I'm thinking you might wanna make sure your guns are all charged up.

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0002=I'll keep this simple. I need you to extract a ~mission(item) from the corpse of a ~mission(ship) and leave it at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)The ~mission(client) passed along the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0003=~mission(client) are hiring. They want someone to head out to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item) from the wreck.

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0004=This is that gig I was telling you about. Seems pretty casual, if you ask me, but I don't have to go out there. Anyway, ~mission(client) want someone to pull a ~mission(item) from a ~mission(ship) corpse and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0005=I know how much love crawling around the wreckage of a ~mission(ship) so I saved this one just for you. And guess what, the ~mission(client) will even pay you for it. All you gotta do is snag a ~mission(item) while you're out there and take it to ~mission(destination).

That's all well and good, but it seems that they owe some creds to the ~mission(client) and have been refusing to use their newfound wealth to settle up. Now, the ~mission(client) want someone to ghost 'em and retrieve the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreck. That way, they get their money back and remind any future idiots that they gotta pay their debts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) Once you get the goods, drop them off at ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0006=Friend of mine said that ~mission(nickname) was posted up in Old38 wasted out of their mind, bragging about how ~mission(TargetName) had scored a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that was, and I quote, 'valuable as hell.'

They're willing to pay for you to head out, track down ~mission(TargetName|Last)'s ship and snatch the loot. Once you do, run it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(client) will transfer the creds once they get it. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger) I think we've all learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of bragging, haven't we?

murderspree_desc_0001=I got a bit of a sob story for you. Year ago to the day, Navy squad came and dusted some of my best. Spaced 'em in the middle of a job with nary a warnin'. Hardly seems right. \n\nNow I'm thinkin' it's about time to settle the score. Heard that there was a level 5 in system and it's too good of a chance to pass up. See, as long as your crimestat's that high, the brave little starmen are gonna be huntin' you down anytime security gets wind of ya. Here's what I say, let 'em. \n\nEvery one of them blues that comes to hunt you, you take them out first. Get ~mission(KillCount) of them and I figure that'll be justice for my crew and a fine payout for you.   \n\nOne little bit extra - once you land the first shot, I need you to do it all in a set amount of time: ~mission(KillTime). The same as it took them to wipe us out. Call me sentimental. 
murderspree_desc_0002=Since you're a level 5, I'm assuming you're one crazy bastard. Exactly the type I need to settle a bet I have going. \n\nMy idiot friend says there's no way someone could take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in ~mission(KillTime). I say that all you need is the right person for the job. Plus, as long as your crimestat stays that high, any security you run into should summon the Navy right to you. Easy pickings.  \n\nWhat do you say? Do it and half the winnings are yours. The timer starts as soon as you shoot the first one.\n\n
murderspree_desc_0003=I'm sure you're aware, but recently the Navy's been trying to clean up Stanton. As someone who's clearly no fan of the law, that's pretty bad for you, and even worse for me. I work for one of the big security firms in the system (not saying which) and all our jobs have dried up since the Navy started taking on a larger role.\n\nWhat I need is a disaster that can prove to the suits with the credits that the Navy aren't the saviors they think they are. \n\nYou're going to be my disaster.\n\nI'll pay you some serious credits to take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in under ~mission(KillTime). And with your crimestat at level 5, the heroic Navy will show up any time you run into security making it that much simpler. I’ll start the time once the first shot lands. Figure a spree of this magnitude should be enough to scare just about anyone into hiring my firm.

northrock_boarders_890J_desc_001=An executive client just informed us that their 890 Jump had been intercepted at ~mission(Location) and boarded by outlaws. They would prefer to have this handled privately owing to the sensitive nature of proprietary data that's being stored aboard. \n\nYour first priority will be to clear all outlaws as quickly as possible so that a recovery team can be dispatched to return the ship to the owner. The longer the outlaws have control of the vessel, the higher the chance it will be lost. I recommend you acquire a team for this outing to expedite matters. \n\nNote that thanks to a small contingent of Security Personnel who stayed aboard, all surviving members of the crew were able to flee in an escape craft. The current status of the remaining security is unknown, but just in case, keep an eye out for friendlies when you engage the hostiles.\n\nSecondly, if at all possible, the client is *very* interested in preventing the theft of the aforementioned data.

northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_002=Northrock received a bounty on a prison escapee that goes by the name ~mission(TargetName).

People fresh our of jail tend to have extra motivation for not going back.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_003=Hey,\n\nGot a bit of a livewire for you. Convicted criminal ~mission(TargetName) managed to escape from lockup and are on the run.\n\nNo clear sign where they might be headed, but I'd say check any spots in the area where they might be able to hack their record clear. The smarter crooks tend to start there. \n\nBet they are not going to be happy about running into you.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_intro=Hey There,\n\nMy name is Braden Corchado and I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system. I may have reached out already, but we try to make it a point of approaching anyone who meets our high standards and encouraging them to complete a pro tem contract. \n\nYou can't do much better than become a Northrock contractor. We have a solid reputation for offering challenging and interesting work at a higher rate of pay then many of our competitors in system. \n\nNow, to get approved, you will need to apprehend one ~mission(TargetName). They have recently escaped from the detention center and your job will be to track them down before they can disappear completely off the grid. \n\nA little hint is that it's safe to assume that the target is going to go try to clear their record. I recommend triangulating your search between the detention center they escaped from and locations where they can hack into the record system.\n\nGet this done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI know it's been a little while, but if you are still interested in doing contract work for Northrock, I convinced the management to give you a reevaluation. If you can successfully complete a bounty for us, we can see about getting your employment status reinstated.\n\nThis pro tem contract is to track down escaped criminal ~mission(TargetName). Try your best to get to them before they can wipe their record at database access point or the job's going to be significantly more difficult.\n\nHoping we can trust you on this.\n \nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

northrock_groupbounty_desc_01=Local law just bounced us a group warrant. They're looking for the capture of several individuals wanted in connection with a major heist, aka ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3).\n\nTake care of the lot in the time allotted, and we're looking a fairly sizable payday. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_02=Advocacy have been hunting down a group, but haven't had much luck. Lucky for them, NorthRock is ready to pick up the slack.\n\nWe got a time restricted warrant for:\n- ~mission(Target1)\n- ~mission(Target2)\n- ~mission(Target3)\n\nBe careful when you engage the targets. I don't want any of them slipping the net and costing us credits. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_03=I feel like you've proven yourself capable, so I think you should be able to handle this time restricted group warrant. \n\nWe're sending you out to neutralize ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). They're most likely not flying together anymore, but at one point they were operating as a pretty cutthroat gang. Racked up quite the hefty felony list before they disbanded.\n\nIt'll be more dangerous trying to capture them all in time, but the payout should be worth it.\n\nFly smart,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_04=Authorities are pretty eager to capture a trio of outlaws in connection with recent crime spree: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nThey're in the wind at the moment, but I trust that you'll be able to track each and every one of them down.\n\nThe payout for apprehending all three should make up for the extra effort needed to capture them in time.\n\nGood luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_05=Northrock got handed a bounty for three criminal associates on the run: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nIf they're smart, chances are they split up, so be ready to hunt them down individually.\n\nGood news is that the pay should make dealing with tight time restriction and extra travel worth it.\n\nFly safe,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_intro=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I may have reached out already, but I wanted to be sure and introduce myself. I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system today, providing a variety of services to all major governmental bodies as well as various private concerns. The reason I am contacting you is because we believe someone with your skills could be a boon to our clients. \n\nNot only that, but I think we'd be good fit for you. Our contractors traditionally get a higher rate of pay than a lot of our competitors in system, and a lot of them tell me how they really enjoy being tasked with the challenging and interesting work we offer. \n\nNow, Northrock holds itself to such high-standards so before we can make anything official, you'll need to achieve approved contractor status by completing a pro tem contract. \n\nI was hoping you could capture several wanted members of an outlaw gang: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3).\n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_groupbounty_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI've been thinking over everything that went down and decided to speak to management. They've agreed to give you another chance but only if you successfully complete a contract for us.\n\nWe can look at reinstating your employment status if you can bring in this criminal trio:\n~mission(Target1)\n~mission(Target2)\n~mission(Target3)\n\nThey evaded the last Associate who went after them, so you bringing them all in would definitely earn you some points.\n\nHopefully you've gotten your act together since your last job.\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_recoverspace_desc_0001=Bit of burner came in. A client of ours got robbed while in transit between systems. Current intel indicates that the job was pulled by a local thug named ~mission(TargetName). Thankfully, they still seem to have the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) in their possession. \n\nNeed you to track this bastard down, recover the property, and return it to our client at ~mission(Destination). \n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_recoverspace_desc_0002=Just got a bit of good news. One of our sources got a tip on some stolen property we've been looking for. Seems that a shady character by the name of ~mission(TargetName) is transporting through the system.\n\nI want you to go find this ~mission(TargetName|Last), recover the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) and drop it off at ~mission(Destination). \n\nThink you can take care of that?\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_recoverspace_desc_0003=So it seems that some missing ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) just turned up. Guess where? \n\nIn the back of a thief named ~mission(TargetName)'s ship. Don't know if they actually pulled the job or just ended up holding the stuff, but it's going to cost them big time.\n\nYou're going to go hunt ~mission(TargetName|Last) and convince them to give you the stolen property back. Once you've recovered everything, fly it back to ~mission(Destination). We can take it from there. \n\nGo out there and get it done,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

They will most likely be traveling with an escort or two near ~mission(Location|Address), and with their connections there is a good chance they will be more skilled than your average pilot. \n\nLet us see what you can do with the odds stacked against your favor.\n\nMost Sincerely,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_UGF_illegal_boss_desc_001=I am not sure if you’re acquainted with ~mission(Location|Address), but ~mission(TargetName) is the one who calls the shots there. I need them eliminated.\n\nThat is easier said then done, I'm afraid. They are notoriously reluctant to see to matters personally, preferring their underlings to handle the dirty work. That said, eliminate enough of the underlings and they will have no choice but to deal with you themselves.\n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_UGF_illegal_desc_001=They say there is no honor among thieves. Today, it seems, you're targeting one of your own. \n\nPlease head to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill ~mission(TargetName). What you do with the others there is entirely up to you.\n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_UGF_legal_boss_desc_001=A senior security official by the name of ~mission(TargetName) is about to have their long career come to a very violent and sudden end. While they are currently at ~mission(Location|Address), they will not be easy to get to. I fear that a bit of work will be required to draw them out.  \n\nI recommend killing enough of their underlings that they will be forced to face you personally. Of course, once they do decide to finally show their face, it should be a rather straightforward matter. \n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_UGF_legal_boss_nocivs_desc_001=A senior security official by the name of ~mission(TargetName) has been marked for termination. While they can be found at ~mission(Location|Address), they will not be easy to get to. I fear that a bit of work will be required to draw them out.  \n\nNormally, I would recommend killing enough of their underlings that they will be forced to face you personally. However, in this instance a more delicate touch is required. While you should feel free to eliminate any and all of the security forces on site, you must ensure the safety of all the civilian workers there.\n\nTiresome for sure, but a requirement none the less. \n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_UGF_legal_desc_001=A security officer by the name of ~mission(TargetName) is in desperate need of an early retirement. They are currently stationed at ~mission(Location|Address) along with a host of other eager types in uniforms. \n\nFeel free to indulge your violent whims, but it is only the death of ~mission(TargetName) which will earn you my credit and thanks.\n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_UGF_targetonly_desc_001=Normally I give you free reign to indulge your darker impulses, but in this instance, restraint is the key. \n\nWhile ~mission(Location|Address) is sure to be teeming with all sorts of life, you are charged with killing ~mission(TargetName) and only them. \n\nNo other deaths will be tolerated. \n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_desc_001=I want you to focus your efforts on one ~mission(TargetName). You should be able to find them and at ~mission(Location|Address). My sources indicate that they might not be alone. ~mission(Location|CaveSize)\n\nAt the very least kill ~mission(TargetName). The others are none of my concern.\n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_desc_002=It appears that one ~mission(TargetName) has been making quite the impression. I received multiple commissions to see them killed. Lucky for them since the individual offers were not high enough, but pooled together are more than sufficient.\n\nFind them at ~mission(Location|Address). I was made to understand that they will not be alone so caution is the key. ~mission(Location|CaveSize)\n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_desc_003=The time has come for one ~mission(TargetName) to bid adieu to this cruel world. \n\nYou will find them and some faithful companions sequestered at ~mission(Location|Address). ~mission(Location|CaveSize)\n\nThey think that teamwork will be enough to overcome your considerable skills. I would wager my credits on you.\n\nEarnestly,\nVaughn
vaughn_assassination_FPS_desc_intro=Firstly, allow me to introduce myself, or more precisely, my vocation. I am sought out when someone is in need of elimination, and I, in return, find the one who shall execute it. \n\nThis provides security to all parties involved as none know the identity of the other. An ideal situation as far as these things go.\n\nI was recently made aware that you may have a proclivity for killing and if true, why should we both not profit from these much needed skills? As such, I offer an opportunity - \n \nSeek out and kill ~mission(TargetName) over at ~mission(Location|Address). What you do with the others who may also be residing there is up to you. ~mission(Location|CaveSize) \n\nSuccessfully complete this task, and I have a suspicion it shall be the start of something quite grand.\n\nSincerely,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_FPS_desc_rehire=While it is true that you have acquitted yourself quite poorly the last time you attempted an assassination on my behalf, let it not be said that I cannot find it within my heart to forgive.\n\nI'm going to offer you a chance to prove yourself capable once more. \n\nSeek out ~mission(TargetName) who is hiding at ~mission(Location|Address) and kill them and whoever else attempts to interfere. ~mission(Location|CaveSize)\n\nDo this and you can consider yourself forgiven.\n\nSincerely,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_H_desc_001=Killing ~mission(TargetName) may end up being quite the challenge. They are aboard a well-protected ship near ~mission(Location|Address) and are most likely in the company of skilled escorts.\n\nA cautious approach may be wise.\n\nWarmest Regards,\nVaughn\n  
vaughn_assassination_H_desc_002=I am eager to see how you will handle this next assignment.\n\n~mission(TargetName) will be traveling near ~mission(Location) with trained escorts aboard a heavily defended ship. Killing them will be no mean feat.\n\nBut I am starting to suspect that you may enjoy the challenge.\n\nWarmest Regards,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_H_desc_003=We have been hired to end the life of ~mission(TargetName). However, they have all the earmarks of a challenging assignment - a well fortified vessel with skilled escorts.\n\nOf course, you have proven yourself most adroit and handling the difficult tasks. You will find the target near ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nWarmest Regards,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_H_desc_intro=I have always been forthright with you, so I will say that this next contract will be extremely difficult.\n\n~mission(TargetName) is notorious for not only their own deadly skills in the cockpit, but they travel with equally deadly compatriots as well. The client neglected to mention to me that several other contractors have failed in the past.\n\nIt will be up to you to track ~mission(TargetName) to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill them. I am afraid it will not be easy. However, you have always risen to the challenge thus far and I'm hopeful that you can do so once more.\n\nWarmest Regards,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_M_desc_001=The latest name for our list is ~mission(TargetName).\n\nThey will be traveling around ~mission(Location|Address) in a better class of ship and with a better class of escort. Approach with caution, and try to make this a clean kill.\n\nRegards,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_M_desc_002=Good news. Received the name of our next victim.\n\nI believe you will find ~mission(TargetName) to be piloting a fairly well-armed vessel while in the company of a few skilled pilots somewhere near ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nI can't say it will be an easy assignment, but it should at least be interesting.\n\nRegards,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_M_desc_003=Our next target, one ~mission(TargetName), might have received word that there is a price on their head. \n\nThey have upgraded their protection detail and are traveling near ~mission(Location|Address) on a better defended ship than usual.\n\nInconvenient, but not insurmountable.\n\nRegards,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_M_desc_intro=I have a special assignment for you near ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nThe name is ~mission(TargetName).\n\nNormally, I would task this to one of my more experienced associates, but the timetable on the life of ~mission(TargetName|Last) has moved up, so the responsibility falls unto you.\n\nKnow that this may be your most difficult assignment to date. Do not be surprised if you encounter several well-trained pilots serving as escorts to the target, who themselves are known to be quite the pilot. \n\nI suspect making a clean kill may prove a bit tricky, but I have the utmost faith in your ability.\n\nRegards,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_S_desc_001=I fear this is another one of those assignments that will take your full skillset to see to completion.\n\n~mission(TargetName) is aboard a very heavily armed vessel protected by at least two equally armed escorts. They are traveling near ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nNot for the faint of heart.\n\nFondly,\nVaughn
vaughn_assassination_S_desc_002=If you hadn't already proven yourself time and again, I would say that this next kill would most definitely cement my esteem of your abilities.\n\nAboard a heavily defended and well escorted ship traveling near ~mission(Location|Address) is one ~mission(TargetName). Please kill them.\n\nFondly Yours,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_S_desc_003=Powerful people make powerful enemies as is evident in this next assignment. \n\nDespite ~mission(TargetName)'s well-appointed vessel and extremely qualified escort ships, it is up to you to see them dead. You should be able to find them near ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nYou have my full faith.\n\nFondly,\nVaughn
vaughn_assassination_S_desc_intro=When I received the name ~mission(TargetName), I knew that you were the one for the assignment.\n\nThey and their wingmen will most likely be your equal in terms of combat skill, but I am wagering they will not have your instincts. \n\nNormally, I wouldn't even take such a difficult contract but you have proven yourself such an asset that I feel confident the outcome will be favorable.\n\nYou should be able to find ~mission(TargetName|Last) near ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nI eagerly await the good news.\n\nFondly Yours,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VE_desc_001=I have a new assignment for you.\n\nDispatch ~mission(TargetName). You should be able to find them at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nI do not expect them to put up much of a struggle. At least not a formidable one.\n\nSincerely,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VE_desc_002=It has been requested that ~mission(TargetName) be killed. I suspect they will not be too difficult to deal with once you find them near ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nSincerely,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VE_desc_003=The next name on my list is one ~mission(TargetName). \n\nFrom what I gather, they can be found near ~mission(Location|Address) and you should be able to put them down rather easily.\n\nSincerely,\nVaughn
vaughn_assassination_VE_desc_intro=Firstly, allow me to introduce myself. To put it rather dramatically, I deal in lives. \n\nPeople hire me when some soul needs to be extinguished, and I in return employ the perfect person to serve as the extinguishant. This provides security to all parties involved as none know the identity of the other. An ideal situation as far as these things go.\n\nI was recently made aware that you may possess skills that would make you of service to me and decided that it would be worthwhile to pursue the validity of this claim. \n \nIf you have any interest in forging a working relationship, I will need a demonstration of said skills. \n\nSeek out and discreetly kill ~mission(TargetName) over at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nDo so successfully and you will be rewarded. Not only that, but you will have proven yourself worthy of further consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VE_desc_rehire=It is not often in life that we get another chance to make a first impression, but I am going to provide to you with just that.\n\nTo say I was disappointed in how things last transpired on your last assassination attempt would be a severe understatement. However, here is your chance to prove yourself capable of more. \n\nKill ~mission(TargetName) over at ~mission(Location|Address) and I will consider the slate wiped clean. \n\nSincerely,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_001=An tricky assignment has just arrived that I think you will be ideally suited for.\n\nExpect to encounter ~mission(TargetName) aboard a heavily armed vessel near ~mission(Location|Address) and accompanied by some of the most highly-seasoned pilots that can be hired. \n\nDeal with the escorts as you wish. As long as you kill ~mission(TargetName), I will be more than satisfied.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_002=I just got off of a comm with a client who felt obligated to monologue about why he needed a target dead.  \n\nI will spare you the details, but know that the assignment's name is ~mission(TargetName). They are a relatively high profile individual and will be traveling near ~mission(Location|Address) in a heavily guarded ship with highly qualified escorts.\n\nI suspect there will most likely be a full defensive reaction to any hostile actions so be prepared.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_003=Believe it or not, but this assignment's name is near identical to one of my earliest contracts. I can't tell if that's because it's a popular name or if it reflects on my having been in the business a very long time.\n\nThat said, this ~mission(TargetName) is very different than the earlier one I dealt with. This one is traveling near ~mission(Location|Address) in a heavily fortified ship with well armed guards escorting them. \n\nIf I am not mistaken, they are going to put up quite the resistance, but hopefully this ~mission(TargetName) will soon be as dead as the first.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_intro=I will not skirt the truth of it. This will be my second attempt at dispatching ~mission(TargetName). The first time cost me a very talented asset.\n\nIt turns out that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is not only a skilled combatant themselves, but they travel with several highly skilled companions making them most difficult to kill. I have traced their current whereabouts to ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nWhile I would hate to see the same unfortunate fate befall you, I believe that you shall triumph where others failed.\n\nI sincerely hope you prove me right.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn
