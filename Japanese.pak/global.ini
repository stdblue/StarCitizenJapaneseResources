dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking=Dumb-fire missiles need no lock and fire instantly but have no tracking capability.\nHeat-seeking missiles require the target to remain in front of the ship for an amount of time dictated by several factors including your distance from the target and their infra-red emissions. Cross-section missiles (like the type your ship is armed with) focuses its tracking on the ships size and geometry. So the further away you are from the enemy, the harder it is for the missile to track.
dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking_Title=Missile Locking (2/2)

dfm_ui_Boosting=To overpower your ship's maneuvering thrusters hold [~action(spaceship_movement|v_boost)]. This will increase your acceleration, but once your ship reaches its top speed the effect of Boost will be negligible.\nBoosting also helps you perform sharp turns by overpowering your maneuvering thrusters to help you achieve a tighter turn.\nYour ship can store a limited amount of the fuel which is used up while Boosting though this does replenish as gases are collected during normal flight.\nIt is important that you bear this in mind and use Boost only in the situations it will make most difference.

dfm_ui_Comstab=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can cycle the various safeties on and off by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_safeties)].
dfm_ui_Comstab_Pad=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can toggle COMSTAB by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_comstab)].

dfm_ui_Control_Frame=The control frame reticle (CFR) shows the goal attitude that your ship is trying to attain.  When torque/thruster error or other outside forces prevent the ship from attaining the goal the control frame reticle will deviate from the nose reticle.   In these circumstances you should rely on the control frame reticle to pilot the ship as the forward velocity vector will always be in that direction.  IFCS will then drive the nose reticle toward the CFR as it corrects the error.

dfm_ui_Countermeasures=When a missile is locked on your ship or an enemy is trying to achieve missile lock, you can attempt to break lock by using a countermeasure.\nTo fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Cont=\nCountermeasures are designed to disrupt specific types of missiles lock.\n~icon(Flare|22|22) The flare produces an intense burst of heat in an attempt to lure any pursuing heat-seeking missiles away from your ship. Flares burn out quickly so missiles may reacquire lock-on if you fire on too early.\n~icon(Chaff|22|22) The chaff explodes into an expanding cloud of tiny filaments designed to confuse radar systems and break the lock of missiles with an electromagnetic lock-on system.\nYou can cycle the type of countermeasure armed by pressing [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_cycle_countermeasure_fwd)].

dfm_ui_ITTS=With a target focused, your ship's targeting system will try to predict where you need to fire to hit the target with each of your weapons.\nIt does so by extending PIPs (Predicted Impact Point) from your Line of Sight reticule. Each PIP corresponds to a weapon and indicates where its projectiles will intercept given the distance and velocity of the target.\nPIPs are only predicted so if your target is far away it may alter its velocity and avoid the projectile. As a general rule, ballistic projectiles will take longer to reach a target than an energy projectile, therefore their PIPs will be projected further ahead.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_explanationTraining_0450_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Explanation=Rolling is a great way to orient your ship to fit through tight gaps or evade incoming fire. Now you give it a go.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_introTraining_0430_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Intro=Moving on. Now this is my favorite part of training: the barrel roll.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_difficultyTraining_0800_Combat_CM_Chaff_Difficulty=Deploying chaff takes more skill than flares. To be successful, you need to put it between you and the missile.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_chaff_explanationTraining_0790_Combat_CM_Chaff_Explanation=Good. Now, a chaff creates a cloud of electromagnetic interference to mask your signature from the missile.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_autoTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Activating landing mode restricts you to decoupled mode, meaning only your manoeuvring thrusters fire, which is handy for precise movement in tight areas.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_manualTraining_0150_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=I've gone ahead and restricted you to decoupled mode, which makes it much easier to position yourself for a launch.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_modeTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_01=Remember Decoupled Mode from taking off? If the Drone gets behind you, enter Decoupled mode to disengage your main engines and allow you to spin your ship around while retaining your original vector.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_player_tryTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_03=Give it a try, just remember to disengage it when you're done.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_autoTraining_0880_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Remember, entering Landing Mode will automatically Decouple your ship, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad as it cuts down your speed.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_doors_openTraining_0110_Take_Off_Doors_Open=Once you're aligned, the tower will open the doors.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_1_introTraining_0470_Combat_Intro_03=Don't worry - it's just a training drone. It handles just like the real thing, but it's weapons are less lethal. Saying that - they still pack a punch so try not to take any hits you don't have to.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_drone_2_killedTraining_0840_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Player_Kill_Drone=Good kill. We're heading back to the landing pad to restock and refuel for the final part of your training.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ejects_before_warning_2Training_1420_Self-Destruct_Player_Eject_Prompt_01=It's the only thing I can't do it remotely, kid. You have to initiate. Hurry.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_explanationTraining_0740_Combat_CM_Flare_Explanation=Last missile was heat-seeking so equip your flares. Helpful tip, don't boost after dropping a flare. Boosted thrusters are much hotter than a flare.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_flare_launch_successTraining_0770_Combat_CM_Flare_Launch_Good=Good.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_free_lookTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_01=Alright. First thing's first, take a look around your cockpit and familiarise yourself with the layout. It's imperative to quickly find and access specific controls. Last thing you want to be doing in a scrap is bringing up the instructions.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_gsafe_explanation_3Training_1130_Flight_G-Safe_Explanation_03=If you need to get that extra edge in turning, you can disable G-Safe, but be warned. An unconscious pilot turns into a dead one pretty quick.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_multiple_pipTraining_0590_Combat_Hud_Pip_Multiple_Reticles=Notice you have multiple PIPs with varying lag? Each of those indicates a weapon on your ship. The computer's trying to compensate for the varying speeds between your ballistic and energy projectiles.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_general_warning_2Training_0370_Flight_Player_General_Warning_02=Let's get back on track. We got a lot to cover.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_general_warning_3Training_0370_Flight_Player_General_Warning_03=Just so we're clear, kid: you will follow orders or you will fail this training exercise.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_general_warning_4Training_0370_Flight_Player_General_Warning_04=Stay on track, kid.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_general_warning_5Training_0370_Flight_Player_General_Warning_05=Sharpen up, rookie. This isn't going to cut it.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_gets_hitTraining_0640_Combat_Drone_Player_Gets_Hit=You're taking hits. Check your HUD for shield and damage status.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_hits_droneTraining_0560_Combat_Fire_Player_Hits_Shields=Good shot. See its shields weakening on your HUD?
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_lags_1Training_0330_Flight_Player_Lags_01=Come on. Keep up
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_lags_2Training_0330_Flight_Player_Lags_02=You're lagging, kid. Hurry up.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_no_weaponsTraining_0730_Combat_No_Weapons=That hit took out your weapons. You'll have to hold out until they come back online. Countermeasures are still online. Use them.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_off_centreTraining_0200_Take_Off_Player_Off-Centre=Don't align yourself with the middle of the doors. You'd be surprised how many 'cruits forget that the cockpit is not the centre of the ship.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_strafe_forwardTraining_0180_Take_Off_Player_Move_Forward=Okay. Now strafe forward onto the taxiway. If you need it, the tower should have lit up your path.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_take_offTraining_0170_Take_Off_Player_Dust_Off=Nice, you're clear of the pad.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_player_testTraining_1120_Race_Challenge_01=Think you can put all this together? Let's see.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_self_destruct_introTraining_1400_Self-Destruct_Intro=Your ship's loaded with military intel, so we can't let it fall into enemy hands. You'll have to initiate self-destruct before you eject.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ship_checkTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_03=Let's get ready for takeoff. I'll do this step by step to show you how it's done. Systems, check. Engines, check. Tower, permission for launch.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_ship_positionTraining_0750_Combat_CM_Ship_Position=Another pro tip: countermeasures are fired backward so never fly at a missile head-on, launch a countermeasure and expect it to work.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_shortcutTraining_1140_Race_Shortcut=Think fast.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_somedamageTraining_0280_Take_Off_Some_Damage=A little shaky, but vertical take-offs take some practice.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_space_brake_introTraining_1110_Flight_Space_Brake_Explanation=If you need to cut speed in a hurry, use your space brake - it's much quicker than dialing back your engines and the moment you let go of it you'll automatically accelerate back up to your previous speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_spire_fillerTraining_1470_Filler_And_Foreshadow_The_Spire=That, my friend, is the Spire. Isn't she a beauty?
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_strafe_forwardTraining_0090_Take_Off_Move_Forward=Now that I'm clear I can strafe forward onto the taxiway.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_strafe_sidewaysTraining_0100_Take_Off_Center_Under_Doors=Now I square my ship up with the ceiling doors ready for a vertical take-off.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_hud_explanation_2Training_0490_Combat_Target_Enemy_Hud_Explanation_02=Shields are drawn as panels floating around the ship. They'll shrink as they weaken until they disappear completely. At that point, your shots will hit the hull and cause lasting damage.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_hud_explanationTraining_0490_Combat_Target_Enemy_Hud_Explanation_01=Okay, now look at the top right of your HUD. You should see you target displayed. This will show realtime damage, shield status and a few other things.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_hudTraining_0480_Combat_Target_Enemy_02=Use your targeting system to target the closest enemy.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_leaderTraining_0320_Targeting_Intro_01=I've just enabled your targeting system. Use it to target me.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_too_much_damageTraining_0310_Take_Off_Too_Much_Damage=Yeah, I don't think your ship can take any more. I think we'll need to get it patched up and try again.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_tower_permissionTraining_0070_Cockpit_Intro_07=Copy that, tower.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_all_deadTraining_1380_Combat_Vanduul_All_Dead=We're clear. Hell of a training session, huh.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_freefireTraining_1370_Combat_Vanduul_Freefire=You're cleared to engage the rest. Good luck.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_intro_1Training_1230_Combat_Intro=Hold on, I've got contacts inbound…
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_intro_2Training_1240_Combat_Vanduul_Contact=Contact! Vanduul fighter, dead ahead.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_intro_3Training_1250_Combat_All_Weapon_Systems_Active=This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill. All your systems are active. This is a live-fire encounter.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vanduul_wave_2Training_1320_Combat_Vanduul_Wave_Two=Stay sharp. We got more hostiles inbound. Looks like there's a Glaive in the mix.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_vertical_lift_offTraining_0080_Take_Off_Dust_Off=Alright, first I want to lift vertically until I'm just clear of the landing pad.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_waitingTraining_0020_Player_Dawdles_04=What are you waiting for?

Turns out the pack that hit that ship are squatting in and old facility on that nearby moon. \n\nI'm just talking here, but it's not crazy to think that they're keeping the cargo there. These outlaws are scum, so it's not like anyone will miss 'em. The company is gonna claim the insurance, so it wouldn't technically be stealing if you happen to... head on down and take it. \n\nAgain I'm... I'm not saying anything here, I'm just...

item_Desc_Dead_Tree=Contrary to its ominous name, the Revenant is actually a subgenus of the Altrucia tree, an indigenous plant of Terra III known for its thick and colorful leaves. Geoengineers introduced fields of Altrucias to Hyperion in an effort to break up the dust storms. Although the project failed, the Altrucia trees adapted to the perpetual wind patterns, shedding its leaves and thickening the wood in the trunk. Botanists initially believed that the Altrucias had died, but on closer inspection, discovered that they were quite alive and thus, the name was born.
item_Desc_Glowing_Vine=Similar to how the plant’s fictional namesake drowned in the ancient Earth play Hamlet, the bioluminescent Ophelia vine is submerged regularly by the tide that rises over the brackish sands it grows upon. The plants bright radiance is owing to the high quantity of luciferin it naturally absorbs from the heavy bacteria content found in its homemoon’s oceans.
item_Desc_Hat_Monocle=As part of their Dafne collection, commissioned in honor of the Port Retanus Metropolitan Opera House Quincentennial, Derion is proud to present their Jacopo line of accessories. Perfect for an elegant night on the town, this diamond-laminate monocle with tungsten chain and gossamer-lined top hat feature the latest upgradable optiVis interface for unmatched comfort.

item_Desc_Moss_Head=Though simple looking, Conner’s Beard moss holds the notable distinction of being considered the first plant subspecies to have naturally evolved on a spacestation. Tied intrinsically with its unique place of birth, the bryophyte can only survive in the specific conditions that the aging station’s life support systems created. The sculpture featured in the Ecosphere is a replica of the gift shop souvenir the moss was originally discovered on by a waylaid botanist.   
item_Desc_Space_Cactus=Capable of growing anywhere up to 5 meters in height, the Kavische is a columnar cactus hybrid that developed on Yar shortly after the introduction of floral into the newly terraformed ecosystem. Adapting the hue of the red sand, the Kavische quickly became one of the predominant plants on the planet. 
item_Desc_Space_Flower=A member of the Tuserac family of flowers, the Emperor Blossom is one of the most recognizable indigenous plants from Terra. For most of the year, the flower is obscured, covered by what appears to be an unremarkable brown husk, similar to the Typha/Cattail of Earth. When an ideal temperature is reached, the plant enters its blooming phase: the petals peel back, revealing the striking colors underneath. Tens of thousands cross the Zaffre Bay every year for the Twilight Festival which coincides with the blooming of this beautiful flower.
item_Desc_Xian_Plant=One of the most iconic images of the Xi’An Empire in the UEE is the unblossomed Centennial Bloom. The growth of this plant is so precarious, even the slightest deviation in atmosphere or nourishment can offset its blooming period. Under sustained optimal conditions, the bloom takes a hundred years to live up to its name, blossoming small bellflowers of striking white and crimson. 
item_Desc10mm_pistol_ballistic=Traditional gun powder based ammunition that fires slugs from a shell, detonated by a firing pin. The slug trails down a barrel to help guide its trajectory.
item_Desc10mm_rifle_laser=The Plasma Coil - Field Fusion tangles 2 streams of plasma energy into a dense coil before unraveling it, allowing it to shoot far distances with intense energy. Unfortunately this process creates a lot of sound for the user, even though many muffle mechanics are usually built within the chamber of weapons that use this type of plasma energy.
item_Desc12g_electric=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.
item_Desc20mm_Tungsten=<-=MISSING=->
item_Desc25mm_special_ballistic=The mX-Shatter Rocket is a rocket that scatters small explosives on impact or after a very brief period of time. Whenever the rocket shoots out the smaller explosives fire off in random directions, excellent for clearing out areas. Every shatter rocket has a cluster of about 20 small explosives that aren't as powerful as frag grenades on their own, but combined are about the same as a frag grenade.
item_Desc25mm_special_ballistic_fragment=The mX-Shatter Rocket is a rocket that scatters small explosives on impact or after a very brief period of time. Whenever the rocket shoots out the smaller explosives fire off in random directions, excellent for clearing out areas. Every shatter rocket has a cluster of about 20 small explosives that aren't as powerful as frag grenades on their own, but combined are about the same as a frag grenade.
item_Desc2ghz_microwave_energy=Uranium Core ammunition stabilizes uranium for portable weapon usage in small doses. Each 'magazine' contains a set charge of power with the uranium and can be safely disposed of/stored after use. When used, it controls an intense amount of radioactive energy from whatever method the radiation is disposed. The condensed radiation is powerful enough to get through most armor types except Heavy/TITAN armor.
item_Desc300i_HAPR_VP_RMI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion HE5.3 features a high output, fuel efficient design. Its thrust output and low fuel consumption make it ideal for long hauls though it has been reported to be somewhat of a missile magnet on occasions where owners have been subject to pirate activity.
item_Desc325a_HAPR_VP_RMI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion HE5.3 features a high output, fuel efficient design. Its thrust output and low fuel consumption make it ideal for long hauls though it has been reported to be somewhat of a missile magnet on occasions where owners have been subject to pirate activity.
item_Desc350r_HAPR_VP_ESI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion Twin HM4.3 is notable for the fact that it utilizes 2 high-performance TR3 thrusters in a small package. An unusual application, the original design was a joint collaboration between Hammer Propulsion and the Origin Jumpworks racing team. With the additional thrust provided by a second thruster the Twin HM4.3 is ideal for applications where speed is the goal. Speed comes at a cost, however; this configuration has a thirst for fuel that rivals much larger single thruster systems, and with all of its available space being taken up by the thruster internals not much space is left for durability reinforcement. This makes the HM4.3 ideal for most racing pilots, but less suitable for combat-oriented missions.
item_Desc5mm_rifle_ballistic=The size of a traditional 5.56mm x 45mm but built for Gauss mechanics, providing very high accuracy and extremely fast projectile speeds. The 5.56mm slug is made out of a dense tungsten and lightweight carbon mixture, to allow maximum penetration in this Armor Penetration form.
item_Desc6mm_pistol_laser=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.

item_DescKLWE_LaserRepeater_S1=Manufacturer: Klaus & Werner\nFeaturing a three-barrel sequential fire design, the Klaus & Werner CF-007 Bulldog repeater is capable of high rates of fire while maintaining accuracy. It has low damage per projectile and, although it has relatively low power consumption over-all, several publications have commented on its somewhat lackluster efficiency. Even so, the CF-007 remains a favorite among new pilots who are outfitting their first ship.
item_DescKLWE_LaserRepeater_S2=Manufacturer: Klaus & Werner\nBadger repeater is Klaus & Werner's dependable second-tier repeating laser. Its increased output (and corresponding power consumption) make it a solid contender in any fight. Power efficiency continues to be a problem with the K&W models, however.
item_DescKLWE_LaserRepeater_S3=Manufacturer: Klaus & Werner\nThe CF-227 Panther is the pinnacle of the Klaus & Werner repeater line for smaller ships. The Panther well overcomes the design limitations of the Bulldog and Badger, creating a true fire-and-forget weapon with a respectable power consumption-to-damage ratio. Pilots who can afford to outfit their ships with Panthers, both in terms of power capacity and credit balance, rarely regret the decision. The greatest limitation of this weapon is its struggle with power efficiency.

I knew you’d be against talking to them, but I couldn’t risk it not happening. You have every right to be angry at me for keeping it from you, but you know how you get sometimes. Honestly, I don’t know how to handle you when you get all worked up. You’ve been that way since we were kids. Remember that incident with Mom’s Cutlass? Guess I wanted to avoid all that drama until everything was official. \n\nSee... dammit, it’s hard to admit this to you ... Freund Family Fuel is running deep in the red and I don’t see a way out. I did… I did everything I could to try and find a way out, put the house up as collateral for a loan… but nothing worked. Just dumb luck I guess. \n\nSelling to Avivar is our only option to stay flying with some creds in our pockets and a shred of dignity. I know you’d argue with all your heart against it, but you don’t know the numbers like I do. This system’s a different place since Dad started all of this. Dad never had to hire a full time turret gunner for protection. Competition’s grown so fierce that the low fuel prices can’t cover our skyrocketing costs. At least if we operate under Avivar’s banner we’ll have some support during these tough times. The business may not be in our name after this, but it’ll still be ours.\n\nI know you hate me right now, but just remember that, as your brother, I love you and only want to do what’s best for all of us. Well, whenever you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here.\n\n-	J     \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

Three runs. I’ve done three runs for you and still haven’t gotten paid. You aren’t the only ones with debts to pay and while this may be your family business, it sure as hell isn’t mine.  \n\nMaybe if you guys actually made sure your clients paid on time this wouldn’t happen. More than once I’ve seen Jameis tell clients to pay him whenever it’s convenient. Guess I shouldn’t be surprised this happened. Freund Family Fuel may be fine with doing a hard day’s work and not getting paid, but the hell if I am. I’ll be filing a breach of contract or lost wages complaint or whatever the hell they’re called against you both the second I’m off this tub. \n\n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

JournalEntry_CrewMember_03_Description=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n/**Comm_Transcription**/\n\nTo: Ben Totland\nFrom: Simon Totland\nRE: Checking in\n\nHey man,\n\nI got chewed out again today. Guess I didn’t get to the turret fast enough. Adena kept yelling at me that we’d all be dead if the ship was really under attack. \n\nBut it’s not like I was dragging my heels. I’ve just never been on a ship this size before. It’s so easy to get turned around on this thing. Almost feels like someone designed this ship specifically for people to get lost on.\n\nTy keeps telling me not to worry about it. He keeps reminding me that nobody’s first run goes smoothly. Told me yesterday that “the only way you learn is by living.” This would all be super overwhelming if he wasn’t here. Not to say it’s not nice to talk to you about these things too, but by the time the message reaches you and you have the time to respond, sometimes the moment’s passed.   \n\nHeard the Captain and his sister arguing again last night. I’m not sure if they realize how loud they are or maybe they don’t care. Had to crank up the volume on my mobi to drown them out, but then I got worried I’d miss a call to get to the turret, so I turned it back down. Still not sleeping very well. Every little bump wakes me up, then it takes forever to get back to sleep. \n\nAt least I’m making some creds and gaining some experience. Once I get paid, I’ll send a portion to Mom. Maybe now that both of us are working things will be a bit easier for her. Oh, did you ever find out how much experience deckhands need on your ship? How great would that be to work this same ship. Sure Mom would love it too. Both her boys, exploring the stars together. Just like she always dreamed. \n\nCrap … gotta run. Talk again soon, brother.   \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I’ve done a full assessment of the ship in its current state and come to a ballpark value. It … well, there’s a lot more work to be done around here than I first thought. I added about half a dozen other fixes to my punch list today... you know what, we should probably talk about this in person. That way I can explain how I got to my total. Fair warning, I don’t think you’ll be thrilled with the news.\n\nI know you told me to hold off on repairs for the time being, but I noticed something today that’s a little worrying. The power plant’s having power spikes under normal operations. Could be a busted regulator or something, but it’s best not to strain the system until I figure out what’s going on. Might have to do with those repairs I did to the shield genny the other day. Won’t know until I run a full diagnostic.\n\nAlso, I tweaked a few things on the turret for the kid. He wouldn’t stop complaining about how slow and unresponsive it was, so I made a few minor adjustments just to keep him quiet about it. Kid’s eager, and works his tail off, but he’s as green as they come.       \n\nOne last thing, I’ve been thinking about your last message, taking Avivar’s buyout seems like the best plan. Know your Dad wouldn’t be happy about it, but he’d understand.   \n\nOh, and tell your sister before you go through with it. She definitely won’t like it, but you owe her that much.  \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

This has been a good week for Avivar in the Stanton System. I closed that contract I was telling you about last week. Had to cut them a deal, but like you say, once they experience Avivar’s amazing service, we’ve got ‘em for good. That gives us three in the system. A few more clients like this and we’ll be turning a profit in no time. \n\nIn other good news, I’ve been able to convince a local fuel concern, Freund Family Fuel, to meet with me about a possible buyout. They’ve been around for decades and have a number of primo contracts. I’ve drafted the offer so it allows them to operate under the Avivar name as long as they maintain our standards. Considering the state of their ship and employee records, it shouldn’t be hard to get rid of them following the first performance review. It’s their contracts that we really want. Not their aging Starfarer. Will let you know when I’m closing in on a deal so you can give it final approval. \n\nI know I’ve only been here a few months, but I see a lot of potential for Avivar in Stanton and have some big plans. Just give me the time and I’ll give you this system. \n\nI’ll be in touch next week. \n\n-	Patricia    \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I don’t have to tell you how important it is for the company that our expansion into the system succeeds. \n\nWith that in mind, I must say that I have my concerns over how Ms. Sarafian is handling the situation. One of my main problems in making an educated assessment is a lack of good information. Ms. Sarafian, despite a number of subtle and not to subtle requests, only submits her required weekly report for me to review. \n\nThat’s where I was hoping you could come in. For here forward, I need you to provide me with a day-by-day accounting of Avivar’s happenings in the system without informing Ms. Sarafian that you are doing so. I reviewed your personnel file and see that you have been an excellent Avivar employee over the years. Since you have been so good to us, you can expect Avivar to be good to you for your assistance and discretion in this matter. \n\n-	MD \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

Bet you think it was so slick of you to sell info on our operations to Avivar. Don’t think I’m going to let you get away with it either. You best watch your back, because one day you’ll turn around and see me standing there. Then you’ll have to answer for what you did to me and my family. \n \nConsider this comm a courtesy. Stop shelling out info on us to Avivar, and get out of Stanton as fast as you can. ‘Cause if we ever cross paths, it won’t end well for you.      \n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I was just on the bridge for the last few hours, bored outta my mind, and it hit me like a lightning bolt. Had to sneak away so I could get this idea to you before I forgot it. \n\nWhat if, at the end of the party scene, we reveal the ship has a smuggler’s compartment that Hector didn’t know about. So he’s had the magical relic on board the entire time. That’s why the pirates don’t want to damage the ship and destroy what’s onboard. \n\nPlus, it gives ‘em a reason to board the ship and take him hostage instead of blowing him out of the sky. Then we can keep that scene we love where he’s locked in that cell and ...\n\nI gotta run. Cap keeps yelling for me over comm. But you get the idea, right? Roll that around in your mind for a bit, and I’ll call you the second Cap gets off my back. \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

manufacturer_DescAEGS=Aegis grew to prominence as a manufacturer of military spacecraft during the First Tevarin War. Favored by Ivar Messer, their orbital bombers grew to public prominence after his infamous victory on Idris IV. When he ascended to become the first Imperator, Messer contracted Aegis as the UEE's primary source of military-grade spacecraft and defenses. During the Messer Era, Aegis craft became synonymous with the ruthless oppressive regime. After the Fall of the Imperator, Aegis' contracts were stripped, their ships fell out of favor with the public, and the company went into a tailspin. They downsized their craft production and turned to manufacturing parts. Their craft are still out there however, the Retaliator for one is still in widespread use among deep-space transport and the occasional pirate brigade.\nOld military ships that have fallen out of public favor due to their prominence during the oppressive Messer Era.

missionManager_CrusaderHunted_Description=Woah! Looks like someone’s been busy.\n\nThat price Crusader just put on your head is some serious chunk of credits. Public Enemy number one. Doesn’t get much more serious than that. \n\nI’d hate to see someone so passionate about their work get put down, so I figured I’d give you some friendly advice. The way I see it, you’ve got three ways out of this. One, you run and hide in some remote corner of black till everyone forgets about all those people you killed (I got a feeling that might take a while). Two, you go to Kareah and hope that you can hack the terminal and lower your crimestat before some greedy civie sparks you. Or three, you kill everyone and everything that comes after you. Sure it’s a lot messier, but you leave a big enough trail of blood and I promise that people will think twice before looking for you.\n\nActually, with the amount of attention you’re pulling, you’re probably doing the rest of us a favor. The more people out there with a contract to hunt you down, the less eyes there are on us. Even better if you happen to kill them. Taking one for the team and all that. Tell you what, for every one of these wannabe bounty collectors you take out, I’ll see that you get a kickback.  \n\nWhatever you do, good luck out there. \n\nAnd lose my contact info for a while.\n\n-Ruto

missionManager_CrusaderWantedTutorial_Description=Hey,\n\nI just saw you pop up on the crimestat board. Real pain, right? I’m in the same ship myself. One little mistake in ECN range and those Crusader Security whacks are all over you.\n\nSure, we could lay low for a bit till the heat is off, but you’re in luck ’cause I know a little fix to improve our crimestat situation. \nTurns out Crusader’s latest construction project, Security Post Kareah, ran into a few ‘problems’ that left it unstaffed, but still connected to the records database. Here’s the plan: you head inside, hack the access terminal with the attached program and lower both our crimestat ratings. \n\nIt’s a total win-win. Unless you like getting hassled by those idiots.\n\n-Ruto\n\n**/ATTACHEMENT:KNOCK^2.APP/**

I just got the estimate from the repair crew. It’s not good. The whole air filter system is going to need to be replaced and that’s going to take some time. Not to mention getting the extra expenditure cleared by Central is going to be a bit of a to-do after the struggle we had getting the last increase through the board.\n\nI’m afraid there is no way we can proceed with opening the station as planned, and, unless you object, I’m going to keep the patrols operating out of their existing posts and delay their transfers until we have a better grasp on the updated timeline.\n\nNot going to lie, it's a major setback. I know how much having this new facility operating meant to you. Darston and myself are going to do everything we can to help get us back on track. \n\nSee you tomorrow,\nPauline\n\nPauline Nesso\n\nFacilities Manager\nCrusader Security\nSecurity Post Kareah

We are sorry to inform you that after careful consideration and review, our investigation has revealed the cause of loss is not covered by the employee policy provided by Covalex Shipping.\n\nPersonal Life Policy 02107 02012000 notes the following exclusions under which benefits will not be paid if the loss:\n\n(A)	results from the Insured's alcoholism or addiction to drugs or narcotics; but not addiction which results from the administration of those substances in accordance with the advice and written instructions of a Licensed Health Care Practitioner.\n(B)	results from the Insured's participation in a felony, riot or insurrection, or involvement in an illegal occupation.\n\nThe preponderance of the evidence collected at Covalex Gundo Station and witness statements indicate that the insured was intoxicated to the point they he lost normal control of his mental and physical facilities and that this intoxication was a contributing cause of the accident.\n\nIt is against the law and considered a felony for an individual to cause the death of another by the operation of devices while under the influence of intoxicants. Even if there may be intervening factors between the fact of operation and the death of another. Felony exclusion makes no benefits payable. \n\nSince your claim was denied, you have the right to an internal appeal. You may request one by filling out a DCR-90 form. If you have questions regarding the information contained in this letter, please feel free to contact our claims department. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJessie Holzburg\n\nClaims Adjuster\nImperial General Insurance

It's ridiculous. There is no way that's true. I know my husband. Darnell had his problems but that's all in the past.\n\nI want you to go Covalex and send me evidence that my husband is innocent. But even if you find out he isn't, you'll still get paid. I know your time is valuable and really, I just want to know the truth.\n \nGood luck, and I hope to hear from you soon one way or another.

Needs to be more detail focused. One more strike? \n- Does a lot to help maintain crew morale. \n\nDarnell Ward Notes: \n- Was a little abrasive at first when he came back, but has settled back into a solid routine. Once in a while still have to remind him about watching his attitude. \n- Punctuality problems seemed to have gone away. Has been on time regularly for past 3 months. \n- Keeps personal space clean. \n- Can sometimes be too diligent in trying to figure out a problem. Over thinks things sometimes which means tasks can take a little longer than expected. \n- Also can lead to taking unnecessary risks. \n- Very proactive though. Will address issues without needing to be told to do so. \n\nNico Theolone Notes: \n- Very focused. \n- Gets job done. \n- Figure out how to mention deodorant thing??? \n\nKiyomi Santos Notes: \n- So far so good. Seems to be stepping into the position well. \n- Good attitude. \n- Reports could be a little cleaner. Have noticed a few typos and errors. Simple things. Should take the time to double check before filing. \n- Schedule rotation suggestion was a good one. \n- Possible candidate for advanced training \n\nMel Ososky Notes: \n- Needs to be more mindful of using mobiGlas during work hours. \n- Has helped to improve the distro rate. Moving more crates through thanks to oversight on the cargo manifests. \n- Can be territorial with responsibilities. Needs to be more willing to let others help. \n\nSelf Eval Notes: \n- Need to be better about respecting that personal hours. I have sometimes taken advantage of employees living onsite and it can blur the lines between on and off hours. Downtime is important. \n- Profits have exceeded the 3% growth mandated by Covalex, in large part to my management. \n- Employee retention has increased. Turnover rate has significantly dropped. \n- Need to be better about following up on things earlier. Don't assume employees are tracking deadlines.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_01_Text=LAST UPDATED: 2945-03-21_16:44SET\n\nOn 2945-03-03 we received our first report of missing BIG BENNY brand vending machines from the Port Olisar commuter hub station.  Alby Mollion, the on call manager, explained that a TERRA MILLS SERVICE TECHNICIAN had come to repair the machine and informed him that it would have to be taken to an offsite center. The following week, shift supervisor Tony Losong contacted Terra Mills Service Center to inquire about the repair only to learn that the so-called service technician had not in fact been associated with the company. It was at this point that Crusader Security was contacted by the Port Olisar administrators to look into the matter. Security vids pulled from the station’s feed captured the suspect leaving with the machine in question but so far, facial match has been a dead end. It is surmised that the suspect was wearing spoofs, faux-vis, or some combination thereof. Attempts to track the suspect’s transport also proved futile as the regtags were traced back to a decommissioned hauler. \n\nOn 2945-03-05, we received a second report from CryAstro station 1267SC where their Big Benny unit was also taken under the guise of repair.  Not long after, dozens of similar reports from other stations around the Crusader sector began to trickle in, stating that a false Terra Mills technician had removed their Big Benny machines. Those separate reports were vetted and indexed under this main casefile once the connection was confirmed. \n\nIn the meanwhile, we have been working with Terra Mills to issue a general warning to all Big Benny machine owners to be on the lookout for unscheduled service technicians and that they should always demand to see credentials. An image of the suspect has likewise been circulated. However, since 2945-03-12 there have been no further reports.\nIn attempt to track down the culprit we have notified scrap yards and secondhand sellers to alert us if someone tries to offer a Big Benny unit for sale. We have also tasked Terra Mills with tracing unusual refill orders surmising that the stolen machines may eventually require more Kacho to be stocked. \n\n**EDIT 2945-03-21 ** We did have a possible hit on the VSS we put out on the suspect’s transport, but reached a dead end after we lost the trail near Grim HEX. We currently don’t have the resources to investigate directly, but I have put in a request for a CI to follow up.\n\n

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Text=Millions of people from around the Empire come to visit Crusader every year. From stunning vistas planetside to a bevy of unique and memorable locations in the surrounding environs, there’s plenty of reasons why Crusader is considered by many to be “Above and Beyond.”\n\nWhat better way to explore the grand expanses of the Crusader than by riding aboard a Genesis Starliner that was built planetside by Crusader Industries. These luxurious cruise ships offer tours of not only the gorgeous upper atmosphere of Crusader proper, but offer a myriad of options and destinations. Why not start with a sunset tour to see a Genesis being built right before your eyes in the beautiful latticework of Crusader Industries; expansive shipyards? From there you can cruise along to the lower atmosphere to experience the colorful cacophony of one of our famous “light storms” or head out into orbit to visit the beautiful icy moon of Yela. Named for the oldest sibling in the childhood favorite fairy tale “A Gift for Baba,” a visit to this frozen landscape will surely have all the makings of a tale of your own.\n  \nFor more information on tickets and timetables, or to learn more about places to see and visit during your stay, please contact the Crusader Visitor Information Center.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Subtitle=Personal Datapad - Dreams, Thoughts, and Inspiration
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\n•	Remember, this is a free flowing expression of your thoughts. Don’t hold back. Don’t edit. Be true and you will find truth.\n\n•	Impact over substance or transformation over rehabilitation?\n\n•	The medium is part of discussion as much as the discussion itself is a medium of the art, but when that message overcomes the piece, is that the ultimate goal? Should the work stand or topple? Stop to ask ‘what if’ but make sure the remaining question is always why.\n\n•	Found another critique - “Though the work is an assault on the space, there remains little bite behind the attack. The only kindness in the experience is that the all the leftover resin has been promised to a local art school. Hopefully it may find use as art yet.” This is what I need. This pain. \n\n•	While I had some concerns at first, I am thrilled that my new hab is proving a fruitful ground for inspiration. Leaving the comfortable familiar behind and embracing the chaos of Grim HEX has been so cathartic I have begun to count losing all my credits as a blessing. \n\n•	You see these other artists who “make it.” Denara with his looms lapping up the critic’s praise, or Tamsa and her painted ships. Their embracing of the commercialization of art is the very poison that is destroying our souls. To expose how deep this commoditization of Humanity would be a true work of inspiration.\n\n•	I watched an ambush today outside the base. It was thrilling and terrifying at the same time, but it was the aftermath that struck me the most. The silence after the predators had flown away, stripping the cargo of their prey, I found myself transfixed by the drifting hulk of the wreck. The twisted shapes losing all function and becoming pure form. Definitely a motif to be explored further. \n\n•	I met a woman today who goes by the name Threetoe. She told me that if she was to die she’d want to be floated out in the asteroids by ‘the Big Sister.” She explained how her mother used to read the ‘A Gift for Baba’ to her growing up and she always related to the character. It amazes me the impact these stories of our youth can shape our very being. What replaces them as we grow older? The stories stop, but the need persists. What are the fairy tales that give us comfort now? The answer came to me as my thoughts were interrupted by cries of “So Yum, So Wow” from a nearby Big Benny’s machine. This is how the story of Humanity will be told. This corrupt consumerism will be the monument that we leave behind. \n\n•	A monument for me to leave behind …\n\n

text_level_info_description_Area18=ArcCorp, Stanton III, is the most visually impressive of the worlds today. While the other planets, even polluted Hurston Dynamics, retain some indication of their natural origins, ArcCorp is now an entirely constructed world. Almost all the land masses have been sculpted, zoned and built upon, leaving nothing for nature. ArcCorp builds fusion engines in bulk, using the underground resources on Stanton III to provide engines for hundreds of thousands of civilian spacecraft every year.
text_level_info_description_Crusader=Located in the trade lanes above Crusader, Port Olisar offers a breathtaking view of the planet below. Owned and operated by Crusader Industries, Port Olisar acts as a gateway to the company’s vast planetary holdings and orbital shipyards. The station offers accommodations to everyone from visiting executives to pilots traveling through the system. Port Olisar also features parking options for larger scale ships with complimentary shuttles to the surface below.

text_level_info_description_Levski=An old mining facility (similar to Gold Horizon style) that was abandoned by the original prospectors when they realized that they couldn't salvage the system. They didn't even break down the facility as they would waste even more money on this sinkhole of a system. When the People's Alliance moved in, they dubbed it Levski after the Bulgarian revolutionary. They expanded into the asteroid rather than across it as more people (refugees, fugitives, and eventually criminals) joined to the community. 
text_level_info_description_MMHC=For years, the Million Mile High Club has been impressing refined and sophisticated clientele with its unique blend of luxury and comfort. Designed by famed architectural firm Ido, this executive lounge features polished hardwood floors, a fully-stocked bar and two floor-to-ceiling aquariums. Whether hosting work associates, friends to watch the latest SataBall match or pulling out the stops for an all-night affair, the Million Mile High Club is the perfect venue for any kind of occasion.

ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_callout3=High-tech
ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_desc=Equally capable of holding a client meeting as well as a ship, Aeroview Hangars have become the definitive choice for the discerning executive. Built with a proprietary modular system, an Aeroview Hangar can be customized around your needs, even accommodating larger ships than most other civilian hangar providers on the market. With an overlooking office space, you won’t ever be far from your business, wherever it may take you.
ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_history=Aeroview proudly claims to be the oldest established hangar manufacturer in Human space. Their design and construction of hangars goes back more than 300 years. In the 27th century, Arthur Nassir formed the company around a rigid code of business ethics focusing largely on design quality, a dedication to ergonomics, and an extreme respect for client confidentiality. Aeroview also famously reserves the right to refuse service to any non-Citizens. While hangar design and housing is tangential, at best, to piracy, Nassir’s outspoken contempt for those who fly outside the law led to the company’s code. When Aeroview was purchased by Shubin Interstellar, the conditions of the sale insisted that the code be adhered to in perpetuity. /n/nWhile the code remains intact, Aeroview’s original business model does not. The Aeroview hangars of the 28th century were palatial affairs built on a case-by-case basis to the specifications of the social elite capable of owning their own spacecraft. In recent years, Aeroview has adapted their tactics to follow in SELF-LAND’s footsteps (although they would never admit it). Instead of custom-building high-class hangars on an individual basis, they now produce a line of modular “business hangars” priced to sell to successful businessmen and other executive-level clients. Unlike other modular hangar companies, Aeroview does not lease the property on which their hangars are established. This is left up to the individual consumer to determine; the Aeroview hangar can be erected at any point in the UEE given 48-hours notification (24 hours, for a steep rush construction fee). Of special note, Aeroview has found particular success in developing hangars for larger scale craft or craft that require additional space for support equipment. Pilots of ships like Freelancers, with multiple crew housings, or Hornets, with weapons racks and a need for more intensive hull repair facilities, generally find it more cost effective to purchase a single Aeroview hangar rather than multiple SELF-LANDs.

ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_desc=Excellence. Refinement. Function. These are the pillars that the architects at Revel & York hold dear when building a hangar facility. They understand that your hangar is not just a space. That it is an extension, a manifestation of its owner. Featuring handcrafted wood paneling, botanical gardens and dynamic wallscreens, Revel & York hangars will feel more like home than home.
ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_history=When the Revel & York engineering corporation set about designing its first hangar some thirty years ago, the reaction was laughter. The company, known best for excessively expensive and visibly uncomfortable furniture, was entering a field dominated by aerospace giants. The laughter ceased quickly as the Revel & York “deluxe” line of hangars became the de-facto spacecraft garage of the rich and powerful. The company’s cavernous hangars, established on ideal landing spaces in top-dollar land agreements, earned their standing reputation for excellence and quality. /n/nRevel & York designers work directly with pilots to develop a hangar experience like no other. R&Y is the only company currently constructing modular hangars designed to support merchantman-class spacecraft like the Constellation and Caterpillar, locking them into a valuable if small segment of the population. Their hangar designs have earned their reputation: between interlocking catwalks (with motorized lifts!) to allow pilots to supervise their spacecraft from overhead, to specially designed Greycat PV buggies for transporting ship crews from module to module, everything is designed for not just the elite pilots’ usability but also their overall enjoyment. SELF-LAND and competitors make a place to put your ship; Revel & York makes a place for you to take it in.

ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_desc=Affordable and utilitarian hangars available in every system of the Empire. Self-Land prides themselves on providing a safe and secure landing experience whether you’re in Terra or Fora. Their modular design and use of prefabricated materials means that Self-Land hangars can be constructed in almost any existing structure, leading to their extensive presence around the UEE.
ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_history=Incorporated by Peter Weathermen, a wealthy guild licensed shipper who made his living on the active spacelanes, SELF-LAND hangars have become an ever-present reminder of just how easy it is for Humans to travel the stars. The corporation was founded on the philosophy that the temporary hangars available to transiting pilots were inaccessible, unaffordable and most importantly unsafe. (Weathermen began developing the company after he was jumped by a gang of dock-thugs who stripped his Starfarer to the hull plating.) /n/nStarting in the mid-29th century, SELF-LAND began a franchising-based expansion across the Human-inhabited galaxy. The first SELF-LAND was established by Weathermen on Vann in the Croshaw System. Seemingly overnight, the company had expanded to a dozen worlds … and then a hundred. Today, the SELF-LAND corporation boasts that they maintain at least one facility on every world in the UEE, with some planets (Terra chief among them) having as many as sixty different complexes. SELF-LAND hangars are fully modular and environmentally controlled. Prefabricated out of the most available common metals, they aren’t necessarily attractive to look at … but they are comfortable and familiar. The SELF-LAND experience on a colony world near Vanduul space is exactly the same as that available to a pilot berthing on Earth. The SELF-LAND corporation takes care of everything, from structure design to land titles. Because of their design, the same hangar type can be used in configurations ranging from skyscraping heights, to the breadth of a plain, to stacked underground, or to honeycombed deep within asteroids.

ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_desc=For commercial and industrial needs, why not consider a hangar from VFG Industrial? Inspired by military design principles, their effective and durable structures are capable of sustaining inhospitable conditions. With a VFG hangar, there’s no such thing as off limits.
ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_history=Tom Vivien, Walter Fink and Ulla Gandil were members of the UEE Army Corp of Engineers who specialized in quickly building pressurized landing zones in combat zones during their service. They founded VFG Industrial shortly after being discharged and attempted to bring their expertise to the civilian market. With so many mining groups and terraformers out there, they believed there was a demand for functional and well-crafted hangars in 'non-ideal' conditions. They were correct, clients came in droves, until the Army attempted to sue them for patent theft. The lawsuit claimed that VFG's entire business was built upon proprietary design briefs written for and owned by the Army. VFG tried to settle in for a long fight, but soon began to run out of resources. With a freeze on their business, no more money was coming in, but the three refused to back down./n/nWhen things seemed bleakest, they received a reprieve, of sorts. ArcCorp was very interested in their hangar building methods, specifically for their mining and terraforming subsidiaries, but also to mass-market to the public. The members of VFG were divided. Fink utterly refused to sell to the MegaCorp, but the other two knew they had no choice. The three finally agreed to sell. ArcCorp's lawyers took over their defense and within a matter of weeks managed to work some backroom black magic to hamstring the Army's case. Fink took a substantial buyout and left the firm. Tom Vivien and Ulla Gandil are technically still on the board, but control of the company has shifted to ArcCorp.

vehicle_DescAEGS_Avenger_Stalker=Initially designed as Aegis’ frontline carrier ship for the military, the Avenger Stalker took a different path, ultimately having a long and storied career as the standard patrol craft of the UEE Advocacy. Utilizing its cargo hold for prisoner transport, the Avenger features a sturdy, reliable hull and the capacity for larger-than-expected engine mounts.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Avenger_Stalker_Renegade=Created as part of the ‘Masters of Flight’ series in conjunction with the flight-sim Arena Commander, the Renegade pays tribute to famed pilot Danny Solomon for his notable work with the Advocacy to bring justice to Bremen. This Avenger Titan comes equipped with a specialized dogfighting focused loadout and a custom special edition livery honoring this iconic ship.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Avenger_Stalker_Titan=Lacking the Prisoner Cells of the Stalker or the EMP Generator of the Warlock, the Titan’s hold is free to carry cargo. Couple that available space with the Avenger’s tried and true combat abilities and you’ve got a light cargo hauler that’s more than capable of handling itself in a fight.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Avenger_Stalker_Warlock=The Avenger Warlock was built towards a single design philosophy: stop ships, don’t destroy them. Probably the closest to a non-lethal fighter, the Warlock is outfitted with a Behring REP-8 EMP Generator, capable of emitting a powerful electromagnetic wave to disable any electronics unfortunate enough to be within the blast radius.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Gladius=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nThe Gladius is an older design which has been updated over the years to keep up with modern technology. In military circles, the Gladius is beloved for its performance and its simplicity. A fast, light fighter with a laser-focus on dogfighting, the Gladius is an ideal interceptor or escort ship.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Gladius_Valiant=Created as part of the ‘Masters of Flight’ series in conjunction with the flight-sim Arena Commander, the Valiant pays tribute to famed defense pilot Condi Hillard for being the first Human on record to defeat a Vanduul in combat.

vehicle_DescAEGS_Retaliator=Manufacturer: Aegis Dynamics\nThis civilian refit of the Retaliator trades the ship's massive torpedo bays for equally massive cargo capacity.
vehicle_DescAEGS_RetaliatorBomber=Aegis Retaliator Bomber
vehicle_DescAEGS_Sabre=Part of Aegis Dynamics’ Phase Two of new ship models, the Sabre was designed as a space superiority fighter for those situations where you need to leave a lighter footprint. Designed to be a rapid responder, the Sabre is more than capable of establishing battlefield dominance for any number of combat scenarios.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Sabre_Comet=Created as part of the ‘Masters of Flight’ series in conjunction with the flight-sim Arena Commander, the Comet pays tribute to famed pilot Captain Kamur Dalion for his work with Aegis to usher in a new era of combat ship design. This Sabre comes equipped with a specialized dogfighting focused loadout and a custom special edition livery honoring this iconic ship.
vehicle_DescAEGS_Vanguard=A hard-charging bulldog of a fighter which features extensive forward-mounted weaponry designed to tear through the shields and armor of other spacecraft. So-named because their multiple-jump range allows them to form the vanguard of any military expedition, Vanguards have seen extensive service against the Vanduul.

vehicle_DescANVIL_Hornet_F7C=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nTo the enemy, it is a weapon never to be underestimated. To allies, it's a savior. The F7C Hornet is the same dependable and resilient multi-purpose fighter that has become the face of the UEE Navy. The F7C is the foundation to build on and meet whatever requirements you have in mind.
vehicle_DescANVL_Crucible=Anvil Crucible
vehicle_DescANVL_Gladiator=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nThe civilian model of the Gladiator appeals to those that want explore the ‘Verse with a bit of added security. Supporting a maximum of two the Gladiator is perfectly equipped to explore and fight with or without a wingman. The Civilian model allows pilots to choose between an extra cargo hold or a bomb bay.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_DFM=[PH] Anvil ホーネット
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_F7A=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nThe UEE Navy's premier carrier-based fighter craft, the F7A is the front-line attack ship for military combat missions. While not outfitted for long range runs, the Hornet can take her share of hits... and dish out a consistent, powerful response.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_F7CM=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nThe closest to the Military load-out as is legally possible for a Civilian model, the F7C-M Super Hornet reattaches the ball turret and offers near milspec parts under the hood. Proving that two heads are better than one, a second seat has been added to split the logistic and combat duty, making the Super Hornet a truly terrifying mark to engage.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_F7CR=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nIf the Ghost is made to hide, the Tracker is made to seek. The F7C-R Tracker boasts an advanced radar suite making it ideal for deep-space explorers who require depth and accuracy in their scan packages. Local militia and larger merc units will also repurpose Trackers to act as mobile C&C ships for their squadrons.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_F7CS=Manufacturer: Anvil Aerospace\nThrough a combination of low-emission drives, low-draw weapons, and Void Armor technology capable of diffusing scans, the F7C-S Ghost is built for the pilot who wants to keep a low profile. The Ghost is capable of slipping past the most ardent of observers to accomplish whatever goal you need to accomplish. Don't worry, we won't ask.
vehicle_DescANVL_Hornet_Wildfire=Created as part of the ‘Masters of Flight’ series in conjunction with the flight-sim Arena Commander, the Wildfire pays tribute to famed pilot Aria Reilly for her distinguished service with the legendary Squadron 42. This Hornet comes equipped with her own personally selected loadout preferences and a custom special edition livery honoring her iconic ship.

vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland\nInspired by Consolidated Outland CEO Silas Koerner’s cutting edge vision, the Mustang Alpha is a sleek, stylish spacecraft that uses ultralight alloys to push power ratios to the limits, albeit sometimes unsafely. And now, with the optional Cargo Carrier, you can have the Alpha’s advantages without sacrificing carrying capacity.
vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Beta=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland\nThe Mustang Beta, with its unprecedented range, is made for long duration flights. The factory standard Tarsus Leaper Jump Engine enables the Beta to travel to the galaxy’s farthest systems with ease, while the ship’s unique Com4T living quarters will make the journey feel like you never left home.
vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Delta=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland\nWhile it may not be able to go toe to toe with some of the military specific ships, by reinforcing the Mustang’s already strong hull construction with Consolidated Outland’s own line of Cavalry Class Mass Reduction Armor, the Delta has a reduced cross-sectional signature that evens the playing field.
vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Gamma=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland\nConsolidated Outland’s design and engineering teams have managed to tweak and refine the Mustang into an admirable racer. The end result, the Mustang Gamma, has smooth acceleration, and power on demand thanks to an innovative package featuring three powerful Magma Jet engines for maximum thrust.
vehicle_DescCNOU_Mustang_Omega=Manufacturer: Consolidated Outland\nConsolidated Outland teamed up with custom tuning company Accelerated Mass Design to create a limited edition racer that features a ramped up fuel intake for faster recycling of the ship’s already impressive boost system. To cap off the collaboration, AMD enlisted resident underground artist Sektor8 to design the dynamic paint job.

vehicle_DescDRAK_Cutlass_Black=Manufacturer: ドレーク Interplanetary\nDrake Interplanetary claims that the Cutlass Black is a low-cost, easy-to-maintain solution for local in-system militia units. The larger-than-average cargo hold, RIO seat and dedicated tractor mount are, the company literature insists, for facilitating search and rescue operations.
vehicle_DescDRAK_Cutlass_DRAK_Cutlass_Blue=Manufacturer: Drake Interplanetary\nSleek, mean, and royal. The Cutlass Blue adds missiles, a more aggressive engine, and Durasteel holding cells in the cargo bay to the standard model. The Cutlass Blue is the outworld militia standard ship of choice for patrols.
vehicle_DescDRAK_Cutlass_DRAK_Cutlass_Red=Manufacturer: Drake Interplanetary\nThe Cutlass Red converts the standard cargo hold to a well-equiped medical facility including an Autodoc. This starbound ambulance features the Nav-E7 Echo Transponder, a long range scanner, and a Secure Plus Docking Collar, making it ideal for search and rescue. This model also features a unique Red Crossbones skin.

Utilizing centuries of manufacturing expertise, the compact precision of the Kruger hull blends perfectly with the trusted RSI thrusters to grant the Merlin exceptional handling and maneuverability while ensuring that it is capable of fulfilling a variety of roles from combat to scouting to scanning. 
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer=Manufacturer: Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern\nFreelancers are used as long haul merchant ships by major corporations, but they are just as frequently repurposed as dedicated exploration vessels by independent captains who want to operate on the fringes of the galaxy.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_Base=Manufacturer: Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern\nFreelancers are used as long haul merchant ships by major corporations, but they are just as frequently repurposed as dedicated exploration vessels by independent captains who want to operate on the fringes of the galaxy.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_DUR=Manufacturer: Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern\nThe Freelancer DUR variant specializes in exploration. Sacrificing 25% cargo capacity of the standard Freelancer for an enhanced jump drive, a more advanced scanner, and an expanded fuel tank may seem like a bad call to some, but those who value discovery over profit will find it to be their ship of choice.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_MAX=Manufacturer: Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern\nFreelancer variant with additional cargo capacity at the expense of weapons. The Freelancer MAX variant sacrifices weaponry for an increased cargo capacity making it ideal for equipment or raw materials transport.
vehicle_DescMISC_Freelancer_MIS=Manufacturer: Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern\nThe Freelancer MIS is a limited edition militarized variant of the classic mercantile ship developed by the UEE. These were produced in very small quantity due to some early payload incidents. This version sacrifices the majority of the cargo capacity to make way for missiles.
vehicle_DescMISC_Prospector=For years, the Prospector has been the universe’s preferred mining vessel for solo operators. Featuring MISC’s sleek design sensibility and a bevy of upgraded high-tech mining tools, the 2947 Prospector perfectly balances form and functionality. 
vehicle_DescMISC_Reliant=With the Reliant Kore, MISC adds to its already impressive lineup of ships, a smaller introductory-class spacecraft. Utilizing advanced Xi’An designs, the Reliant features broad, sleek wings, omni-directional thrusters and a fully-articulated two-seat cockpit that supports horizontal and vertical flight modes. All of this combines with a larger carrying capacity than many ships in its class to make the Kore a natural choice for short-range hauling, or with the simple addition of a few optional components, this can-do ship can do anything you dream of.
vehicle_DescMISC_Starfarer=The Starfarer differs from traditional bulk freighters in one key way: it is a dedicated fuel platform. The Starfarer is designed not only to load, store and protect fuel stasis units, it is designed to take in spaceborne hydrogen and then refine it for use without landing. The Starfarer can be used to ferry traditional bulk cargo pods (see diagram) but in such cases the fuel refining equipment would be useless. This equipment is modular and can be swapped out for another mission package for dry operations!
vehicle_DescMISC_Starfarer_Gemini=The United Empire of Earth military uses an adapted ‘rough and tumble’ variant of the Starfarer for their front line operations. The G2M Gemini, more commonly the Starfarer Gemini or ‘Star G,’ trades some cargo capacity and maneuverability in exchange for reinforced armor, increased shielding, more powerful engines and stronger versions of the three manned turrets. The Gemini also includes an optional missile pod, which can be swapped for the fuel intake unit on the ship’s nose (see below for details.) Missile pods can be mounted to either Starfarer variant.
vehicle_DescORIG_300i=Manufacturer: Origin Jumpworks GmbH\nIf you're going to travel the stars... why not do it in style? The 300i is Origin Jumpworks' premiere luxury spacecraft. It is a sleek, silver killer that sends as much of a message with its silhouette as it does with its particle cannons.
