NEW	Aciedo_RepUI_Description=Following the conclusion of the First Tevarin War, Humanity was eager to begin exploring the stars again. Aciedo began life as fledging ship manufacturer focused on creating long-range exploration vessels. While they saw moderate success with their initial ship design, it was the included communication drones that stood out for their reliability and transmission success. Captains across the newly formed Empire began asking Aciedo to sell them commdrones directly. Within the first year of offering them, sales skyrocketed, and it wasn't long before Aciedo decided to stop manufacturing ships entirely. Today, they are the UEE's largest communication service provider, handling over 70% of all comms, and operate commrelays, commarrays, and commdrones across the Empire.

NEW	DXSH_MCAV_Ad_ANVL_Hornet_Commercial,P=Legendary Fighter Pilot Area Riley once said Give me a fully loaded Hornet, and I ll shake the gates of Heaven.\n\nAnvil Aerospaces Hornets have faced Vanduul, Shion, Pirates and Criminals.\n\nAnvil Aerospaces Hornets have logged more combat time and kills in more theatres than any other ship in the history of Space Combat.\n\nBattle Tested in the harshest conditions, the Hornet has proven time and again its ability to withstand damage, and still be able to dish it out.\n\nWith all the punishment it handles on a daily basis, don=t you think the new Hornet can handle yours\n\nAnvil s New Hornet F7C, see your authorized ship dealer for options.
NEW	DXSH_MCAV_Ad_CNOU_Mustang_Commercial,P=We are drawn towards the familiar. It is safe, reliable.\n\nBut it can shackle us to the ordinary when in our souls we long to strike out and become something new.\n\nWe started with a simple match. Dare to dream. Dare to challenge the expectations of what has come before. \n\nTo embrace the Unique, to put everything on the line.\n\nOnly when we risk everything can we discover something truly special, and redefine what it means to drive with the stars.\n\nTo explore the farthest reaches, to race on the cutting edge, to Protect what you love.\n\nSay goodbye to the familiar, and welcome the brand new Mustang, where risk, meets reward.
NEW	DXSH_MCAV_Ad_ORIG_M50_Commercial,P=Space, the best ships gracefully dance across its expense, the worst clumsily plod across its face. The new M50 doesnt have time for any of that.\n\nInstead, it simply slices its way through.The 2944 M50 was designed with one goal in mind: Make the ship that will win the next Murray Cup.\n\nThe surprising thing is, Origin may have just about done it.\n\nThe stats are an orgy of mind-bending numbers but it comes down to two things. Less weight and more power. Youll notice the nose cone has grown what I can only describe as a mustache, added to stabilize all the additional thrust that the retooled and updated Twin Hammer HM4point3 drives spew out. And the refinement doesnt stop there.\n\nThey ve narrowed the front fuselage, moved the wings forward for better balance, shaved the cockpit viewpane down to the finest it could still be and not shatter in your face.\n\nThe result. A pure flying machine. Each movement on the stick translates directly into unadulterated throttle action. Welcome back to the glory days of flying.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Game_Objective_Briefing_02,P=We need this area cleared of all combatants. Terminate every last one of these outlaws with extreme prejudice.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Good_Kill_01,P=That's a kill.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Good_Kill_05,P=Hostile down.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Halftime_02,P=Time to change tactics. We're moving to a different infiltration point.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Kill_Assist_01,P=Nothing more lethal than teamwork.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Killing_Spree_02,P=Multiple targets down. Fine work, marine.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Killing_Spree_03,P=You are a damn efficient killing machine if I've ever seen one.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Last_Player_Alive_01,P=You're all that's left, Marine. Everyone's counting on you now.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Last_Player_Alive_02,P=You're the last Marine standing. Make their sacrifice mean something.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Loadout_Confirmation_01,P=Got your gear? Head to the readyline.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Lose_Player_01,P=One of your squadmates went off-grid.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Lose_Player_02,P=Orders came in. One of your squadmate's been reassigned.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_01,P=I call that mission a complete failure. I think you're better than that, I think you know that too. 
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_02,P=You all tried your best, and this time it wasn't good enough. But there's a lesson to be learned in that. Make sure that you learn it.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_03,P=We lost today. No getting around that. The important part is what comes next. Are you going to carry defeat with you, or are you going to rise above it?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_04,P=I am dissapointed in all of you. You let the UEE and the Marines down. Not just cause those outlaws got the better of us, but because I know you can do better. It's up to you to prove me right.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Loss_05,P=Those outlaws made a mockery of us today. That doesn't sit well with me, and sure as heck hope it doesn't sit well with you either. Remember that feeling next time you go to battle and use it.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_01,P=Let me be the first to say well done. You went in with a job to do, and you sure as heck did it. 
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_02,P=I've been at this awhile and... well, that was a sight to see. Congrats. First drink's on me tonight.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_03,P=This operation wasn't just a success, it was a thing of beauty. Each and every one of you poured your blood and sweat into it, and let me tell you, that means something. I'm proud of you. 
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_04,P=Mission accomplished. But that's just what Marines do, isn't it? Pack it up, and let's go home.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Match_End_Win_05,P=That was some fine work you did out there today, and thanks to you, those outlaws won't be a problem anymore. All of you should feel proud of yourselves.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Melee_Kill_04,P=Nothing wrong with getting up close and personal. 
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_01,P=There we go. Who's got time to kill 'em one by one.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_02,P=Damn. How many was that?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Multi_Kill_03,P=That'll teach them not to bunch together.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_01,P=Marine down and in need of medical.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Need_Medic_02,P=We've got an injured Marine in need of help.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_One_Enemy_Left_02,P=We're down to the last target. Take 'em out.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_01,P=No way we let things stand at that. Let's get back out there.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_02,P=They hit us hard, but we got to go back and hit them harder.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_03,P=I ain't gonna surgar coat it, that was a mess. Learn from it. Don't let it happen again.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_04,P=We may've lost the battle, but we sure as hell can still win this war.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_05,P=We lost control of the situation. That can't happen. Next time, we need to focus, and we need to work together. 
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_01,P=That was a complete bloodbath of epic proportions. Consider me dissapointed.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_02,P=They completely dismantled our operation six ways from Sunday. We need to be better than that.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_03,P=What the hell did I just witness? That went about as wrong as wrong can go.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_01,P=We got them that time, but stay focused. This ain't over yet.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_02,P=And that is how you stop a threat dead in it's tracks. Well done.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_03,P=Mark one in the Win column.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_04,P=That was one heck of a fight, but don't get cocky. There's plenty more work to do..
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_05,P=We put them in their place for now, but that's not going to stop them for long. Just another day on the job. Let's do it again.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_01,P=In and out, and not a single Marine down. Couldn't ask for a better op.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_02,P=That was near flawlass work, and you all deserve accomendations, but that comes later. Now we need to stay focus, It only takes one lucky shot to change everything.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_End_Win_Shutout_03,P=All that training really paid off. You put down those outlaws before they even had a chance to know what hit them.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_01,P=You waitin' for an invitation?!? Get out there!
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_02,P=Move out!
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Marine_Round_Start_03,P=Go! Go! Go!

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_30_Seconds_Left_02,P=Stomp them skags. We're running out of time. 
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Encouragement_01,P=Don't punk out now.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_First_Blood_02,P=Hit hard and fast, that's what I like to see.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_First_Blood_03,P=Bet they weren't expecting that.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Gain_Player_02,P=Got some new blood on the team.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Game_Objective_Briefing_01,P=Alright, scumbags, listen up. We got rats in the clubhouse and I need them dead. Every single one.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Game_Objective_Briefing_02,P=Here's the roll, we got a Marine team breaching. It's you or them.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_01,P=Got 'em.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_02,P=Tag, you dead.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_04,P=Bye, bye.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_05,P=That was fun to watch.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Good_Kill_06,P=They won't be gettin' up anytime soon.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_01,P=Hey, shut up for a second.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_02,P=Who's ready to have a little fun?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Greetings_03,P=Everyone here? Good.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Kill_01,P=Got 'em
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Kill_02,P=Nice toss.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Warning_01,P=Frag! Frag!
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Warning_02,P=Grenade!
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Grenade_Warning_03,P=Run, idiot!
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Halftime_01,P=We're gonna hit them from a different angle. Get ready.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Halftime_02,P=Time to mix it up. Let's go at 'em from the other side.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_01,P=Someone totally nicked your kill.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_02,P=Clippin' 'em ain't the same as finishing 'em, but it's all the same to me.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Kill_Assist_03,P=Seems like you couldn't get the job done yourself.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_01,P=That's some bloodlust right there.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_02,P=Ravenous. I like that.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Killing_Spree_03,P=Don't stop 'til your heart stops beating.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Last_Player_Alive_01,P=Take a sec. Breathe. It's you or nothin'.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Last_Player_Alive_02,P=Time to hero up.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Selection_01,P=Arm up and get set, people. We got some killin' to do.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Selection_02,P=Grab what you want, we'll sort it later.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Loadout_Selection_03,P=These are UEE Marines, so pick your load-out carefully.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Lose_Player_01,P=Hold on. That son of a bitch skeeved out.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Lose_Player_02,P=Wait a second. I lost one of our team.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_01,P=You're lucky they killed you because I wanna do so much worse.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_02,P=(off-mic) I ain't goin' back! (exchange of gunfire)
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_03,P=Go, go, go let's get outta here.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_04,P=I set us up, make a perfect plan, and you just had to go and mess it up didn't you?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Loss_05,P=Well we got beat, but then again, they're Marines and we're, well, we're us, so its not too big of surprise really.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_01,P=That'll teach 'em to try and roust us.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_02,P=Scav the bodies. You earned it. Make sure you vent 'em when you're done.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_03,P=Fine job, my wonderful scumbags. Those UEE pukes didn't know what hit 'em.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_04,P=And that is why we are still here. Who's drinking?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_End_Win_05,P=Trouncing those Marines felt a billion times better than I thought it would. I say this calls for celebration.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_01,P=Alright everyone, let's get this done.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_02,P=Ghost 'em.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_Countdown_01,P=5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Here they come.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_Countdown_02,P=We're going in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Match_Start_Countdown_03,P=Give 'em hell in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_01,P=Ain't nothing like it, right?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_02,P=Drop 'em.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_03,P=Good night.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Melee_Kill_04,P=Who needs a gun, right?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Multi_Kill_01,P=That'll hurt their chances.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Multi_Kill_02,P=It's nice when they clump together like that, right?
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Multi_Kill_03,P=Just mowin' 'em down aint't ya.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_One_Enemy_Left_02,P=Almost there. Finish them off.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_01,P=What the hell? You gotta do better than that.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_02,P=Fine. They got lucky this time. Load up and hit 'em again.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_03,P=Alright, okay... no, we still got this.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_04,P=You wanna let those fascist punks walk all over you. Get mad!

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_01,P=Jesus, people, I just... I don't even know...
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_02,P=These are Marines. Did you think this was going to be easy? You better rack your game up or I'll rack your brain with a pipe.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Loss_Shutout_03,P=Another show like that and I'm gonna get out of here.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_01,P=There we go. One down.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_02,P=Hell yeah, people. That's what I like to see.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_03,P=This is our station!
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_04,P=You're getting private stock tonight. Keep it up.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_05,P=That's one for us.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_Shutout_02,P=That. That. Just keep doing that.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_End_Win_Shutout_03,P=There you go, the Empire's finest laid to waste.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_Start_01,P=Go get 'em.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_Start_02,P=It's all up to you. Kill 'em or die trying.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Outlaw_Round_Start_Countdown_02,P=Mags and frags up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_1,P=With the Aeros' win that round, this match is one point closer to being decided.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_2,P=A decisive round victory for the Aeros as they show what skill and teamwork can accomplish in the battle arena.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_3,P=As the Aeros claims the win for that round, they've got to be feeling better about the outlook for this match. Here's hoping that Jata can pull back.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_4,P=Jata falls as the Aeros clinch the round.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Angeli_Aeros_Win_Round_5,P=Aeros take this one.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_1,P=The carrier is taken out with a stun.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_2,P=With the carrier is stunned you got to ask where their team was on that one.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_3,P=You get that ball and it is basically like painting a big target on yourself.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_4,P=The carrier went for the opening, but wound up with a face full of stun.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Carrier_Stunned_5,P=Yeah, that press is going nowhere with the carrier locked.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_1,P=Slater Vonn used to say use the electric field like it's another teammate.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_2,P=I once saw Soren Redmond score a goal off a field bounce like that.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_3,P=Using the field like it was intended!
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_4,P=I like a player who uses the whole arena.

NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Hitting_Electric_Field_5_Jata,P=Angeli's_Jata's going for better ball positioning with a bounce off the field.
NEW	DXSH_MCCV_INDI_SM_Sataball_Cara_Ball_Intercepted_1,P=Look out. Gotta watch your passways.

NEW	DynamicEvent_FleetWeek2022_Description=*FOR IMMEDIATE SYSTEM-WIDE RELEASE*\n\nAttention, Nine Tails forces have seized control of several commercial platforms near Orison. Using an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter (IFFI), they have taken over the restricted air space surrounding the platforms and only Nine Tails affiliated ships can gain access to the area. This has severely hampered Crusader Security's initial attempts at retaking the platforms. As such, Crusader has requested that CDF forces assist in shutting down the inverter and eliminating all hostile presence. Any available CDF volunteers are encouraged to provide support.\n\nAdditional Intel:\n* While the inverter is active and the airspace inaccessible, CDF has managed to gain control of a local shuttle system and route it to access Solanki Platform without the Nine Tails knowledge. Volunteers will need to head to the Crusader Industries Showroom on the Commercial Platform and get to the rooftop to find the shuttle that will travel to the occupied platforms.\n* The IFFI is believed to be located in a locked storage container on a cargo barge docked at the central Admin Center.\n* Access codes for the IFFI container are in the possession of the leader of the Nine Tails forces, Mendo Ren. \n* Past experience with Mendo Ren indicates that he is unlikely to show his face and risk capture. However, if all his lieutenants are neutralized, we believe he will have no choice but to take command of the forces in person and provide us the opportunity to retrieve the codes from him.\n* In addition to the shuttle system, Crusader Security has informed us that there are several vehicles on the platforms available for CDF to commandeer. These vehicles will be the only way of reaching the Admin Center. NOTE - If all of the vehicles within the restricted air space are destroyed before the inverter can be shut down, then there will be no way of reaching the cargo barge and the CDF will be forced to retreat.\n* The platforms are protected by Nine Tails controlled Anti-Air weapons.\n\nPlease be aware that SAIC Rowena Dulli from the Advocacy is the official attaché to the CDF and will be running the operation.

DIFF	FleetWeek2950_Family_Body_01=Your loved one has just taken the first step towards a proud life in Naval service. You may have questions about what they will experience in basic training, the safety of your relative/friend, and what kind of contact you can expect during their training and subsequent deployment.\n\nWe know that this can be a scary time for some people and hope that this will offer some peace of mind about the wonderful opportunities that can result from this decision.\n
DIFF	FleetWeek2950_History_Body_02=This may come as a surprise, but Invictus actually goes back several centuries to the days when the UEE was known as the United Planets of Earth (UPE). Shortly after the First Tevarin War began in 2541, Humanity suddenly found itself in need of an organized military force at a size previously unneeded. To this point, aside from the hostage situation with the Xi’an in 2530, there had only been local security forces under the control of the central Human government.\n\nWith Humanity facing an imminent and overwhelming threat, a fleet needed to be raised and trained quickly. The Tribunal sent out an immediate call for recruits to create this army.\n\nTransport ships on each of the settled planets would load up these volunteers and travel to a training facility on Mars known as Invictus. \n\nOn the morning of 2542-10-12, families and communities gathered at launch pads around the UPE territories to celebrate those that were going to defend against the alien invaders. As the conflict continued, more recruits would gather on that day to travel to Invictus to begin their training.\n\nOver the centuries, as the Empire has expanded, space travel has become even more accessible and most recruits are able to self-report, the need for Invictus Launch Week’s has diminished. The spirit of it, however, is stronger than ever.\n\nInvictus is a time to celebrate each other. To celebrate bravery, duty, and commitment to the goals that define Humanity at its finest.\n\nWelcome to Invictus.\n
DIFF	FleetWeek2950_Testimonial_Body_01="To me, it was never really a choice. I know a lot of people grapple with the decision, but honestly, it never crossed my mind. I mean, both my parents got their Citizenship from military service, so maybe that was a factor. There was a moment though when I touched down on the tarmac, I was suddenly seized with this fear that I wasn’t going to be able to make the cut. That was the scariest thing to me; being afraid that I was going to let down my parents and all the people who proudly wore the uniform before me. Thankfully, the Navy isn’t about me. My brothers and sisters built me up and made me the starman that I am today."

NEW	IAE2952_Sign_CDFHistory_body="A system's best defense will always come from its residents."\n\nSpecial Agent-in-Charge Bryce Balewa argued this point for years before becoming a leading proponent for the Civilian Defense Force (CDF), a volunteer militia called upon by the UEE military and Advocacy to provide support during times of crisis. His extensive experience in law enforcement convinced him a strong and trusted partnership between not only local security forces, the Advocacy, and the Navy, but also skilled individuals, would be the best security option for helping to safeguard the people of the UEE. In 2944, Balewa gave a speech at the Civilian Security Summit on this exact subject and was approached after by Amanda Xiang, a prominent lawyer and militia rights activist. Together, Balewa and Xiang drafted a proposal calling for the formation of the CDF so locals, either independently or as part of a militia, could be quickly deputized as provisional law enforcement in times of an emergency. The Civilian Defense Force was officially created in January of 2947 and after months of intensive planning, the fledgling organization had its first mission to help evacuate people on Tangaroa (Helios II) threatened by sudden and intense volcanic activity. Whether it’s defending shipping lanes from raids by increasingly aggressive outlaw packs or running relief to those affected by natural disasters, the CDF has quickly proven to be a vital part of system security across the empire and has become a beacon of the people’s power to overcome adversity when they work together.

DIFF	Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_02_Body=On July 7, 2884, the UEES War Hammer was part of the naval defensive action against the Vanduul now commonly known as the "Fall of Caliban." While providing cover for the civilian evacuation of the system, the turrets were fired so frequently and for such an extended duration that XO Sander Freelin’s after action report noted that "turret support struts had begun to warp from the heat of the sustained fire." Gunner Tobin Lemk commented in a letter home, "I could hear my sweat sizzle as it dripped off me." As a result, Aegis Dynamics reworked the cooling systems in future Javelin models.
DIFF	Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_03_Body=While no sign of the incursion remains, the UEES War Hammer was boarded in a surprise assault on June 25, 2861 when a Vanduul boarding ship, known in the Navy as "Spikes," made it past the UEES War Hammer’s point defense systems and punctured the hull. While five off-duty starmen tragically perished in the first moments of the assault, the crew were able to rally and overwhelm the Vanduul boarders before they managed to gain control of any vital parts of the ship. These brave starmen were instrumental in the War Hammer’s eventual victory that day.
DIFF	Invictus_999SquadTerm=SQUADRON 999 F8 LIGHTNING\n\nThe F8 Lightning was developed by Anvil Aerospace as a replacement for the previous generation F7A Hornet fighter. The UEE selected the Anvil Lightning for production because of the Hornet's string of military successes and its overall familiarity with active pilots. The Lightning was developed specifically to counter what the military saw as the rising Vanduul threat of the 2940s, intended to outfly and outfight the current generation of Scythe and Glaive spacecraft. \n\nTo put this new craft through its paces, the Navy's elite test unit, Squadron 999 were given full access to these next generation fighters. After dozens of flights and simulated battles, the skilled "Wreckless" pilots of the 999 provided valuable feedback that helped hone the Lightning into this imposing vehicle poised to make history.

DIFF	Journal_General_Healing_Content=Since its recent introduction, there’s no denying that regeneration technology has changed modern medicine for the better. Across the Empire, patients can now recover from injuries that would have been fatal in the past. However, as impressive as regeneration is, it is not a replacement for traditional care and treatments.\n\nBelow, we will outline a few important tips on regeneration along with some basic medical practices to help safeguard your health.\n\n--REGENERATION--\n\nRegeneration is the medical process in which a holistic bioscan known as an ‘imprint’ is used to recreate a near perfect copy of someone down to their memories. Because of the unique properties of the imprint, it maintains a remote connection to its source at all times and ensures that it can only regenerate someone after they experience a fatal event. \n\nThis connection, known as an ‘echo’, also means that traumatic experiences lower an Imprint’s Viability Score (IVS). Repeated regeneration may produce irregularities during the regeneration process and eventually render the imprint unusable.    \n\nTo create your very own imprint, visit a Tier 1 or Tier 2 medical facility and register on a kiosk. Once complete, that site will then be where you next regenerate. You can also store an imprint aboard a properly equipped vehicle. If the location or vehicle where your imprint is stored becomes unavailable, a back-up will always be available at your primary residence and you will regenerate there. Please note that having an active CrimeStat may have an impact on your regeneration site.\n\nHowever, because of the effect of imprint echoes on the regeneration process, it is important to remember that receiving first aid and medical treatment is always preferable to being regenerated. The following breakdown outlines basic first aid to deal with a variety of injuries to help avoid needing to regenerate.\n\n--FIRST AID--\n\nThe first step when dealing with an injury is to identify how serious it is using a visor HUD, a self-evaluation (i.e. PIT), or if assisting someone else, a medical device. All injuries can be divided into three severity categories:\n\n- Minor injuries can be treated by Tier 3 (T3) medical facilities and are highlighted purple.\n\n- Moderate injuries can be treated Tier 2 (T2) medical facilities and are highlighted mauve.\n\n- Severe injuries can be treated by Tier 1 (T1) medical facilities and are highlighted pink.\n\nTo fully treat an injury, seek out an appropriately tiered facility at a rest stop, landing zone, or medically equipped vehicle. Attempting treatment at an incorrectly tiered facility can temporarily relieve symptoms, but the injury itself will remain. If you are alone and in need of transportation to a medical facility, you should contact a trusted acquaintance or use your mobiGlas to create a rescue service beacon.\n\nWhile injuries can only be treated at an appropriate medical facility, medication can be administered on site to temporarily alleviate associated symptoms. Before heading out a trip, it’s smart to bring along single dose pens, medical attachments, or full healing device with you.\n\nInjection pens are easy to carry and administer, but you will need to bring multiple pens to cover various symptoms and they can only be used once.\n\nSmaller medical attachments, like the LifeGuard for the Pyro Multi-Tool, allow for diagnostic scans and can administer a healing agent like Hemozal, but cannot treat other symptoms. They are typically used in conjunction with injection pens. \n\nFull medical devices like the ParaMed from CureLife provide detailed diagnostic scans and allows for the administration of multiple medicines along with full control of the dosage. However, it can be bulkier and more expensive than other options.\n\nFor ease of reference, here is an alphabetical list of common symptoms and the recommended medicines to relieve them.\n\n--COMMON SYMPTOMS--\n\n- Concussion – Caused by an impact to the head, individuals with a concussion will experience slower reaction times and have a harder time maintaining their balance. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine. \n\n- Health Loss – As displayed on your mobiGlas or bioscan, your ‘health’ is a simplified diagnostic number derived by combining information from several important monitored vitals. Sustaining injuries will cause you to lose health. Health can be restored by administering a healing agent like Hemozal.\n\n- Impaired Mobility – Caused by injuries to the limbs, torso or head, impaired mobility will make getting around difficult. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Incapacitation – Individuals who are incapacitated have had their health levels reduced to zero and will be unable to move. This is a potentially fatal condition and a healing agent like Hemozal must be applied must be applied in order to restore mobility. The amount of time until the condition is irreversible will be displayed on your mobiGlas. Note that factors like sustaining additional injures or having other confounding medical issues may impact how long you have. \n\n- Muscle Fatigue – Caused by injuries to the limbs, those suffering from muscle fatigue will move slower and have their refined motor skills affected. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine.  \n\n- Muscle Weakness – Caused by injuries to the arms, muscle weakness makes it difficult to do activities that require strength. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Ocular Inflammation – Caused by injuries to the head and results in vision obscured by inflamed blood vessels. Can be relieved by a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Partial Paralysis – Caused by injures to the limbs, partial paralysis makes it so the affected area is severely impaired resulting in the loss of the ability to do activities like running, climbing, and interacting with objects. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Respiratory Damage – Caused by injuries to the torso, this affects lung capacity and makes breathing or prolonged physical exertion very difficult. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Stunned – A temporary loss of consciousness that leaves the individual unable to move for the duration. Will relieve itself after enough time passes and consciousness is regained.\n\n--BLOOD DRUG LEVEL AND OVERDOSE RISK—\n\nWhile giving first aid is vital, know that it comes with its own risks. Administering medication will increase an individual’s Blood Drug Level (BDL) as will imbibing recreational drugs or alcohol. \n\nA high BDL can create a feeling of intoxication and may result in difficulty moving, blurred vision, and loss of refined motor skills. For your safety and other, it is strongly recommended that you avoid operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n\nOnce your BDL reaches a dangerous level it is called an overdose. Individuals experiencing an overdose will be stunned and will gradually lose health until they become incapacitated.\n\nFortunately, BDL will reduce naturally over time. Administering a detoxicant like Resurgera will speed the process and make it so you are no longer stunned. \n

In order to navigate these uncharted waters, and better establish the role of modern mercenaries, some of the largest firms banded together to form the first iteration of the Mercenary Guild. Since then, the Guild has helped ensure the rights of mercenary and security forces to operate with the UEE by protecting their members from fraudulent companies, offering advanced training, providing access to specialist supplies, and lobbying for members who run into legal complications.

I run a modest security outfit and am always on the lookout for capable people who don't rattle. If you're interested in picking up some extra work, we should talk. I'll send my details.
NEW	MilesEckhart_IntroInPersonLawful_1,P=Hey there, sport. Grab a seat. Sorry for the locale, don't look like much but the homemade stuff has some kick. Anyway, I've been hearing good things about you. Real stand-up sort. Just the type of people I like to know. As I mentioned, I run a small security outfit, we handle all sorts of ops, so I'm always on the lookout for people who know how to handle themselves in a scrap.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCaptorsattackersWhilstKeepingHostagesattackedAlive_2,P=We've just been hired to retrieve another poor bastard who's been abducted. Same drill as before, keep the hostage alive, whatever happens to the captors happens.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCriminal_2,P=Another bounty came over the spec if you're interested. Have a look.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCriminal_4,P=This one came straight from the Guild. It's a high value, high risk target. Watch yourself with this one.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_1,P=A contract just came through to go look into several ship wrecks in the area. One problem. The people responsible for making the wrecks are still in the area and they might take issue with you, so expect a fight.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_3,P=High risk retrieval just came in. Check out out the details and see if you're interested, otherwise I'll pass it along.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_1,P=Been getting a lot of requests to chase down ship wrecks. Usually they're a sleepwalk, but they can get dicey real quick depending on which area they're sending you to. I'll send you the request from the insurance company, just follow their instructions and collect your creds.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_3,P=Guess some idiot pilot went and got themself killed, so we've got another contract to find the wreck.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackageInAGivenTime_2,P=Just got pinged from another delivery. It's time sensitive so don't take the gig if you can't make the deadline.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackages_2,P=Need another delivery if you got the time.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDropOffAndPickUpItems_1,P=This one's gonna be a hand-off. Client's a bit worried about the folks on the other side of the deal, so figured a little muscle to handle the trade would be smart. It'll be on you to make sure the transfer runs smooth as ice.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_1,P=An escort job just tumbled free and wondered if you might be available. Should be easy money, but keep your eyes open.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_2,P=Need a babysitter for a ship run. Take a look and see if you're interested.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_1,P=It's a basic escort mission, the client's got a handful of stops they need to make. You follow and keep them out of trouble. Not too tough, right?
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_1,P=We've gotten word that an assault's building against some honest-to-god law-abiding folks and they need some help. Pay's not great, but hey, it's not always about the money, right? I'm kidding.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_1,P=We've got a target that we need to take down. I've coordinated with local law and bounty hunters so it's totally above board. Anyway, you aren't going to be able to take them in a stand up fight, so you'll need to trap them.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2,P=Got another scumbag who's ready for the swift hand of justice... and worth a sizeable bounty. Up for another ambush?
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_1,P=Here's the deal, I've managed to secure a retainer for local law enforcement agencies. I just got word that they're moving on some criminal elements and want some backup.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2,P=Another chaffeur job just came across the spec. Have a look and see if you're interested.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulRecoverStolenCargoGuardedByCriminals_2,P=Law enforcement and Advocacy have been cracking down on cargo theft across the systems and are paying operators for the safe retrieval of stolen cargo. Anyway, I put the squeeze on a couple local scumbags and got a line on some hot merch in the area.
NEW	MilesEckhart_LawfulSearchAWreckForCorpseOrEvidence_1,P=This job's a retrieval op. Need to collect a special bit of- let's say "salvage." I'm gonna give you the honor of going to the wreck, and finding it.
NEW	MilesEckhart_MissionFail_6,P=The whole thing's gone div and I'm left holding the stick. Hope you're proud of yourself. 
NEW	MilesEckhart_OncePlayerSits_1,P=So... don't look like much, do ya? Just kidding. So here's my boilerplate pitch, Eckhart Security handles escorts, VIP protection, hostile extractions and even some militia work when they can afford us. Anyway, a job came in late last night. Some idiot hauler thought it'd be a good idea to shave some flight time by cutting through low-sec space and got his crew vented. Company needs to retrieve the ship's blackbox to claim insurance on the lost cargo. Should be a romper job: get in, get out, but all my people are tied up with bigger ops, so I figured I could use this as a chance to make a new friend. I'll send the details, look them over on your own time and if you're interested, hit me back.
NEW	MilesEckhart_RevisitYoureCurrentlyOnAMission_2,P=You got the details, so get moving.
NEW	MilesEckhart_SitsInTheCornerOfTheDarkBarHePerksUpWhenHeSeesYou_1,P=Hey! Over here. How you been? Grab a seat. Come on. Get in here....
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtPrisonHard_2,P=Got a dangerous one for you. Probably the less I talk about it the better.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_1,P=Seems one of our clients has been picked up by some two-bit security outfit who fancy themselves real do-gooders. Anyway, our enterprise doesn't benefit with this client incarcerated, so I need you to get them out.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_3,P=I swear, I don't know how some of these idiots have stayed alive long enough to make enough money to keep us on retainer. Anyway, we've got another client cooling their heels in a low-sec clink. You free to boost them?
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulKillInnocentOrRivalCriminal_3,P=Hey killer, feel like earning some extra creds? Got another target that's living on borrowed breath.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_2,P=Since they're in the stealing mood, I figure no one will mind if we help ourselves. If they do, I trust you'll handle them.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_1,P=Clients are looking for someone to track down some ships they lost. I don't know if they're trying to retrieve evidence before the law does or what. To be honest, I didn't ask.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackageInAGivenTime_1,P=Contact of mine just hit me up. He's got some product he needs moved quick and quiet. I'm talking invisible here, no scans, no checkpoints. You get pinched with this, you're on your own.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackages_2,P=Need some low profile product that needs to be moved. I'd skirt any heavy security scans if you get my meaning.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffABomb_2,P=Exciting news, slick. Something needs blowing up, and you get to be the lucky one to do it. 
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffAndPickUpItems_2,P=So one of my shakier clients is a little nervous and wants us to handle a hand-off. You give 'em ours. We take theirs. And if they try anything... well, you take care of it.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_2,P=You free for another protection op? Got a client who needs a heavy hitter on their wing.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_2,P=You got time for an escort op? It's another staggered one so you'll hit multiple spots. Have a look.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustFindOnemultipleItemsByScavengingOrKillingAndLootingNoHelpIsGivenFindingTheItems_1,P=Got a retrieval op for you. Now, you should know that the owners of the items in question are going to be resistent to the idea of giving up their cargo. I trust you'll be able to change their mind.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_2,P=So one of my more - lets say verbal - clients has apparently pissed off the wrong people. Needs some protection and defenses laid down to help in case they retaliate. Hoping you could handle it.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2,P=Got another name that needs to be marked off. I've worked out the time and place for the ambush, just need a trigger to do the deed.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_2,P=It's another muscle job, back up the client and shoot up whoever they want shot up.
NEW	MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2,P=Got another passenger that's looking for low profile transport.

NEW	PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Agree_IG_002,P=Only caught a glimpse, but I'm sure I saw something.
NEW	PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Agree_IG_003,P=What the heck was that?
NEW	PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_001,P=I didn't see nothing.
NEW	PH_PU_GENOUTLAW4_M_CB_Relaxed_NoticeVisualResponse_Ignore_IG_002,P=I must've missed it.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_001_HiThisIs=Hi, this is Dulli. Glad to see you stepped up for another emergency. We're still not entirely clear why, but the Nine Tails have taken over the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms and we need you help us regain control. While their inverter device is running, only Nine Tails ships have access, so for now our only way in is via shuttle. Once inside however, there should be several vehicles already in the restricted area that will be operational and should help you disable the inverter. Head to the shuttle as soon as you're ready.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_002_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli. Thanks for lending us a hand again. So far, all we know is that Nine Tails have taken over several Crusader platforms by using an inverter to control the Restricted Airspace. We haven't heard any demands so we don't know if they're after something in particular or just causing chaos. What we do know is that until the inverter is shut down only Nine Tails ships and any vehicles already on the platforms have access. That means our ships don't work and we'll need to shuttle you in. I'll provide more details as they come, but for now, head over to the shuttle as soon as you're ready.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_003_DulliHereThanks=Dulli here. Thanks for volunteering again. Here's the situation. A large group of armed outlaws known as the Nine Tails have seized control of four Crusader platforms using a Restricted Airspace inverter. This makes it impossible for any non-Nine Tails ships to approach until the inverter is deactivated so that will be your primary job. We've gone ahead and commadeered a shuttle to get you to platform, and once you're inside you should hopefully be able to find a vehicle within the Restricted Area to use. Head to the station once you're ready.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_001_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli with the CDF. Just wanted to thank you for volunteering. Anyway, we need your help taking back some Crusader platforms from the outlaw gang known as the Nine Tails. They have set up an inverter to seize control of the platform's Restricted Airspace so only their ships can access the area. Since we can't fly in ourselves, we got a shuttle ready to take you to the platforms where we want you to deactivate the inverter. Gather any gear you need and make your way to the station. I'd also recommend creating an imprint at Orison General in case you need to regen. Talk to you soon and thanks again.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_002_HelloThisIs=Hello, this is Dulli with the CDF. Thanks for volunteering. Here's the situation. Nine Tails are currently controlling four platforms and the Restricted Airspace around them, preventing anybody but their own ships from approaching. We need you to get inside to find and deactivate the inverter. We're currently using a nearby shuttle station to send our forces to the closest platform. Gather any gear you need and head there now. You should also create an imprint at Orison General in case you need to regen. Thanks again and talk to you soon.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_003_ThisIsDulli=This is Dulli with the CDF. I appreciate the help. Here's the current sit-rep. A large group of armed Nine Tails operatives have taken control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms using an inverter system, making it so only their ships can fly into the area. This means a conventional assault's impossible. Instead we're using a shuttle from a nearby station to get our people on site in order to shut down the inverter. Grab your gear and we'll send you over. Oh, I generally advise all CDF volunteers to set their regen at the local medstation in case things go bad, so I'd recommend hitting up Orison General before you come out. Thanks again.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_001_JustSawYou=Just saw you signed up and wanted to say I'm glad we have some veterans answering the call. We're going to need experienced volunteers like yourself since the Nine Tails have gained control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms. We need you to head there as soon as you can to help us take it back. Head to the shuttle once you're ready.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_002_GladToHear=Glad to hear you're going to be joining us for another operation. The Nine Tails have managed to take control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms. We're counting on you to shuttle over to the platforms and help us take them back. Make your way there as soon as you're ready.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_003_ItsDulliJust=It's Dulli. Just wanted to thank you for volunteering. Having tried and tested operators on our side is always beneficial for the new recruits.  Long story short, Nine Tails have seized control of the Restricted Airspace around multiple Crusader platforms. We can't launch a full aerial assault until you fight your way through and help us retake it. Take the shuttle to the platform as soon as you can.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_WithCrimeStat_Siege_IG_001_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli. I appreciate the effort, but it looks like you've got an active CrimeStat. If you're able to clear that up, we'd be happy to have you. Otherwise, there's too great a chance you'd get mistaken as one of the Nine Tails.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_WithCrimeStat_Siege_IG_002_ThisIsDulli=This is Dulli with the CDF. Thanks for volunteering, but we can't accept anyone who's got an active CrimeStat. There's a chance that you could be mistaken for an outlaw in the heat of battle. Get it resolved and we can talk.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_WithCrimeStat_Siege_IG_003_HeyThisIs=Hey, this is Special Agent Dulli with the CDF. Unfortunately, we can't let you volunteer on this one until you resolve your current CrimeStat. We've tried it in the past but there are just too many instances where allies get mistaken for criminals. Anyway, come back when you get it squared away.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_HeresTheLowdown,P=Here's the lowdown. The lieutenant of this platform's already been neutralized but the anti-air is still operational.

The lieutenant's been taken out but CDF volunteers haven't found an IFFI here.

There aren't any ships to commandeer here, but if you're able to take it back from the Nine Tails, you should be able to make your way to the cargo barge by foot.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_VeryHardIsland_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_003_ThisLastPlatforms=This last platform's the Admin Center. I guess it handles infrastructure or something. Anyway, there won't be any vehicles to commandeer here, but you should have the ability to get to the cargo barge by foot.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_002_ThisC2Could=This C2 could make a big difference to the Op. Not only can the starlifter hold its in own, but being able to move ground vehicles could come in real handy. As long as you can avoid any remaining anti-air defenses that is.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_003_NiceAC2=Nice, a C2. The CDF has worked with these on other operations. They're sturdy and the cargo space gives a lot of flexibility. Looking forward to seeing what you can do with it. Just be sure to keep an eye out for any remaining Nine Tails AA when you're flying.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_001_TheStarlifterIs=The Starlifter is an impressive piece of military hardware. More that a few battles have been won with the M2s help. Will be good to have one in the air. Just be careful engaging with any remaining AA defenses.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_002_SeeYouFound=See you found a Pisces. As long as you avoid any direct AA fire, a smaller craft like this could be a good choice for infilitrating the platforms. But if you find an option with more armor that might be the safer choice.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_003_IWouldHave=I would have gone for something with a bit more armor than a Pisces, but then I'm not the best pilot. In the right hands, a smaller craft could be a smart option for navigating the platforms. Guess we'll see.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_StarRunner_Siege_IG_001_YeahStarRunner=Yeah, Star Runner could be a good choice to move some people to other platforms.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_StarRunner_Siege_IG_002_YouEverFlown=You ever flown one of these before? Manuevering thrusters stick a bit too much for my liking, but we'll take whatever we can get.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_OthersLastHope_Siege_IG_003_GotAnImportant=Got an important update for everyone. We have lost all of the available ships inside the restricted zone, but thankfully not before we were able to get some of our personnel onto the central platform. We just have to wait and see if they can get that inverter shut down before its too late.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_PlayerLastHope_Siege_IG_001_IWantedTo=I wanted to let you know that we've lost all of the ships within the Restricted Airspace. That means there won't be any more CDF volunteers coming to help you until you shut down the Inverter. You'll be fine though. Just focus on the task at hand, and get it done.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_PlayerLastHope_Siege_IG_002_NowIDont=Now, I don't want to stress you out, but I feel like it's important that you know we've lost all our ships. That means no one else is going to be able to make it out to the central platform unless you successfully reset the Restricted Airspace. I just want to tell you good luck. We're all counting on you.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_PlayerLastHope_Siege_IG_003_HeyListenUp=Hey, listen up. You're officially on your own out there. All the ships have been destroyed so we can't get any more of our people to the central platform until the Restricted Airspace is reset. I need you to step up and get it done. You got this.

And while there's plenty left, I just want to remind y'all that having flyable ships is vital to us reaching the inverter and resetting the Restricted Airspace. Let's try to keep any additional losses to a minimum.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_Siege_FirstThresh_IG_003_OkayWeJust=Okay, we just did a quick check and it seems that we've already lost about a quarter of the ships we have available. That may not seem like a lot, but since we can't retake these platforms without them, it's vital that we try to avoid any additional losses.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_Siege_LastThresh_IG_001_ThisIsBad=This is bad, people. We've almost lost all the ships we have. If the last few get taken out, then it's mission over. I want to see some defensive flying out there.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_Siege_LastThresh_IG_002_NotGoodDown=Not good. Down to our last few ships. We lose these and the Nine Tails win. I want all pilots to operating at 110 percent, clear?

We need to be extra careful with the half we have left. This mission counts on us being airborne and until the Restricted Airspace is reset, we won't be able to bring in more.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_MissionShip_Siege_MidThresh_IG_002_WereLosingToo=We're losing too many ships. Over half of them are gone, and if we lose the second half that's it. We won't be able to retake the platforms.  So please, use caution.

All of the Nine Tails command have been dealt with and we just need to find their inverter to restore control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. Get down there and get it done. If you need any more details, check your mobi.

The Nine Tails commander and lieutenants are all neutralized. Now we just need to find and disable their inverter on the cargo barge to stop their reinforcements and allow our ships access again. Your mobi has been updated with all the details.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_BossDead_RepeatOccur_IG_003_HeresAQuick=Here's a quick brief. The Nine Tails Commander and Lieutenants have been dealt with. We're just searching the barge for that inverter to restore command of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader. Any questions, check your mobiGlas for a full breakdown.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightWelcome=All right, welcome to the operation. Here's the situation. A short while ago, Nine Tails outlaws infiltrated and attacked these commercial platforms. Your primary goal is to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, that way we can grant our ships access and block Nine Tails from bringing reinforcements to the platforms. \n\nWe know that the Nine Tails are using an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter to control vehicle permissions, so that's your target. We think it's being stored somewhere on the central cargo barge in a locked storage container. Unfortunately, the Nine Tail in charge of this mess has been identified as Mendo Ren, a longtime member tied to dozens of robberies and murders. \n\nBased on his M.O., we know he'll keep a low profile until we eliminate the other Senior Level Nine Tails. So travel to each of the platforms, neutralize the Nine Tail Lieutenant there, then engage Mendo once he comes out of hiding to get his access codes and shut down the inverter. Right now, the platform you're heading towards is Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residencey for visiting VIPs. You might find a few small ships stored there. Crusader's given us permission to commandeer them. You're going to need them to reach the cargo barge when it's time as the platform's shuttle system doesn't directly connect to it. I'll provide updates as you progress. Good luck.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatYoure=Now that you're here, I wanted to get you up to speed on the operation. You're approaching a small network of platforms that Crusader uses for VIP Sales. Nine Tails outlaws have seized control of the air and platforms and we need to take them back. Your first objective will be to return control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. The Nine Tails are using a device called an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter so they can bring in reinforcements while our own ships are locked out. \n\nWe know that the device is being hidden in a locked storage container somewhere on the cargo barge docked at central platform. It seems however that the only person with the container's access codes is Mendo Ren, a veteran Nine Tails outlaw, who is in charge of this attack. Having dealt with him before, we believe that he will stay hidden until he is forced to get involved. This means that to get to Ren, you will first have to neutralize the Nine Tails lieutenants he's assigned to each of the platforms. Once you take them out, you can get the codes from Ren, and shut down the inverter. \n\nThe platform you're headed to now is Solanki Platform. I'm told Crusader uses it to house VIPs that are visiting Orison. There should be a few small ships here that we have permission to use. Comandeering vehicles will be vital to us reaching the central platform as it is disconnected from the shuttle system. I'll make sure to update you if anything changes. With your help, I have faith the CDF is going to come out on top today.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_003_BeforeYouArrive=Before you arrive at the platform, let me give you a high level brief of the situation. Members of the Nine Tails outlaw pack seized control of five platforms outside Orison. Our biggest concern at the moment and your main objective will be regaining control of the Restricted Airspace. The Nine Tails have smuggled an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter into that area which is keeping all our ships out and letting theirs in. \n\nWe need to get the Inverter shut down as soon as possible, but doing so is going to be a bit tricky. The device is being stored in the cargo barge docked at the central platform, and the only one with the codes to access it is the Nine Tails commander, Mendo Ren. Now, from the intel we gathered, Ren will stay out of sight unless necessary. That means we will need to remove the Nine Tails Lieutenants from the platforms to draw him out. Once we take him down, we can get the codes from him and take the inverter offline.  \n\nCurrently you are headed towards Solanki platform, which is used by Crusader to host visiting VIPs. Thankfully, there are several small craft stored there that we'll be able use to move between platforms. We're going to need them to reach the central platform and the cargo barge when the time comes since the shuttle system doesn't connect there, so don't waste the ships. That should be all the info you need for now. I'll check back in soon. The full mission details and current status will be updated in your mobiGlas. Stay focused, watch yourself, and let's get this done.

Your primary goal is to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, that way we can grant our ships access and stop Nine Tails reinforcements from reaching the platforms. We know that the Nine Tails are using an Indentity Friend or Foe Inverter or IFFI to control vehicle permissions so that's your target. It's being stored somewhere on the central cargo barge in a locked storage container. Unfortunately, the only one with the access codes is the Nine Tail in charge of this mess, Mendo Ren. \n\nFinding him and getting the codes is your first task. Once you have them we can finally shut down the inverter. Right now, the platform you're heading towards is Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residencey for visiting VIPs. You might find a few small ships stored there that Crusader's given us permission to commandeer. You're going to need them to reach the cargo barge when it's time as the the platform's shuttle system doesn't connect to it, so use them wisely. I'll check in with any updates as you progress.

We have managed to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, but there's still plenty of work to do. All remaining Nine Tails forces and anti-air defenses under their control need to be dealt with before we can fully regain the platforms. \n\nRight now, you're heading towards Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residency for visiting VIPs. If you don't want to use your own vehicle, you might find a few small ships stored there that Crusader's given us permission to commandeer.

You're welcome to use your ship to get around, but if needed, there should be several small craft stored there that you could use as well. That should be all the info you need for now. I'll check back in soon. Just stay focused, and let's get this done.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NoMission_Siege_IG_002_IToldYou=I told you that shuttle has been commandeered for official CDF personnel only. Either sign up through your contract manager or leave. If you get off that shuttle, you'll be trespassing in a combat zone.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NoMission_Siege_IG_003_HeyITold=Hey, I told you we can't have random bystanders wandering around an active crisis area. If you aren't going to volunteer, don't get off that shuttle. Get me?

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_Siege_BossAlive_RepeatOccur_IG_002_AllRightHeres=All right, here is the rundown on where the op stands. It looks like Ren, the Nine Tails Commander, is still out there. We need to find him and take him out if we want to get the codes to restore control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_Siege_BossAlive_RepeatOccur_IG_003_SinceYoureHeaded=Since you're headed back into the fight, here's where we're at. Latest intel suggests Ren is still down there.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_Siege_ExpNeg_IG_001_ListenImAfraid=Listen, I'm afraid that with the way things currently stand, the CDF doesn't want your help on this mission.

With your current CDF standing, there's just no place for you on this mission. I respectfully ask that you return to Orison as soon as possible, and stay out of our way. Otherwise, you could be charged with trespassing.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_Siege_ExpNeg_IG_003_ImNotSure=I'm not sure what you're planning, but the CDF doesn't need your assistance on this current mission. It could be different in the future, but right now we just can't trust you to perform as needed. Please head back to Orison before you get yourself into trouble.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_Siege_MiniBossesAlive_RepeatOccur_IG_001_GoodWasWaiting=Good. Was waiting for you to show back up.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_Siege_MiniBossesAlive_RepeatOccur_IG_003_EvenThoughYou=Even though you have all the details in your mobi, I wanted to personally bring you back up to speed on the operation. We're still hunting for the Nine Tails lieutenants so that should be your focus. Once we wipe them out, their commander will have no choice but to engage us.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_HospNotSet_Siege_IG_001_HeyBeforeYou=Hey, before you head out to the platforms, you might want to think about making an imprint at Orison General. If worse comes to worse and you need to regen, it'll make things a lot easier for you.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_HospNotSet_Siege_IG_002_WordOfWarning=Word of warning. These platforms are a warzone, so you probably want to have an imprint at Orison General if you haven't already. Save yourself a longer trip back.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_HospNotSet_Siege_IG_003_HeresATip=Here's a tip before you head out. Make sure you've set your imprint to Orison General, so you can get back to the fight quickly if things go wrong.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_NFZInactive_Siege_IG_001_WithTheRestricted=With the Restricted Airspace back under our control, you can take your own ship instead of the shuttle if you prefer.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_NFZInactive_Siege_IG_003_FyiNowThat=FYI, now that we've retaken control of the Restricted Airspace around the platforms, you can take your own ship instead of the shuttle if you want. Just watch out for any active anti-air defenses.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_NoMission_Siege_IG_001_ListenIGet=Listen, I get that you're eager to join the fight, but I can only allow official CDF volunteers to use the shuttle. Sign up through your contract manager if you're really interested in helping.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_NoMission_Siege_IG_002_SorryThisShuttle=Sorry, this shuttle is for CDF volunteers only. We still need help so feel free to sign up through your contract manager.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_PostMission_Siege_MissionLost_IG_001_WeveShutDown=We've shut down the CDF operation since we were unable to stop the Nine Tails. Don't get on that shuttle. Crusader's on site now picking up the pieces.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_PostMission_Siege_MissionLost_IG_002_LookTheresNo=Look, there's no reason for you to get on that shuttle. The operation's over. I've turned the scene over to Crusader Security so they can do their assessment and start cleaning up.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_PostMission_Siege_MissionLost_IG_003_IWouldntGet=I wouldn't get aboard that shuttle. There's nothing for you out on those platforms. The mission's over, Nine Tails won. Crusader Security's closed up the area for their investigation and they don't need any help.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_PostMission_Siege_MissionWon_IG_001_HeyYouDont=Hey, you don't need to board that shuttle. CDF forces were able to drive out the Nine Tails. Crusader Security's locking down the platforms as a crime scene.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_PostMission_Siege_MissionWon_IG_002_IAppreciateThe=I appreciate the enthusiasm, but the mission's over. We managed to get Nine Tails off the platforms.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Station_PostMission_Siege_MissionWon_IG_003_WereAllGood=We're all good here. CDF was able to take care of the Nine Tails situation so there's no need to board that shuttle. I'd advise against going out there since Crusader Security has already taken over the scene.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Exit_RestrictedArea_NFZActive_Siege_IG_001_DammitITold=Dammit, I told you that would happen. I'll try to get them to disable it remotely, but I don't think there's enough time.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Exit_RestrictedArea_NFZActive_Siege_IG_002_ShitYourSelf=Shit, your self-destruct's kicked in. I'm trying to get Crusader on comms to try and shut it down, but I think we're gonna run out of time.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Exit_RestrictedArea_NFZInactive_Siege_IG_001_IToldYou=I told you this would happen. Get back into the restricted area before it's too late.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Exit_RestrictedArea_NFZInactive_Siege_IG_002_TurnAroundNow=Turn around now. If you get back into the restricted area, that should shut off the self-destruct.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Exit_RestrictedArea_NFZInactive_Siege_IG_003_ShitGetThat=Shit. Get that ship back in the restricted area before that timer counts down.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Exit_Shuttle_NoMission_EasyIsland_Siege_IG_001_AllRightI=Alright, I warned you. Now you're officially trespassing in a combat zone.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Exit_Shuttle_NoMission_EasyIsland_Siege_IG_002_FineHaveIt=Fine, have it your way. You're officially trespassing in an active crisis area and will be flagged as a combatant.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Failed_Mission_Invictus_aAlly_tSystem_FromAlly_IG_001_AttentionThisIs=Attention, this is SAIC Rowena Dulli with the CDF with an unfortunate update.  Our volunteer forces were unable to stop the Nine Tails, however the platforms are once again under Crusader control and Invictus can continue on impededed. Thank you.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Failed_Mission_LastHopeDied_Siege_IG_001_AllCdfPersonnel=All CDF personnel on the central platform have been eliminated and we've lost any hope of resetting the Restricted Airspace. I'm aborting the mission and ordering everyone to evacuate the platforms. Make your way to the shuttle now.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Failed_Mission_LastHopeDied_Siege_IG_002_WeJustLost=We just lost the last CDF volunteer that was still on the central platform. Without them we can't reset the Restricted Airspace. I wish there was any other option, but I'm afraid I have to abort the operation. All volunteers are to report back to Orison via the shuttle.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Failed_Mission_LastHopeDied_Siege_IG_003_IAmSad=I am sad to report that there are no more CDF personnel within range of the inverter. And without any ships to get us there, I've got to pull us out. Head to the shuttles now. The mission's over.

We lost the entire fleet of available ships which leaves us no viable ways of resetting the Restricted Airspace. The Nine Tails win.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Failed_Mission_Orison_Siege_aAlly_tSystem_FromAlly_IG_001_AttentionThoughThe=Attention, though the CDF forces were unable to stop them, thankfully the Nine Tails have withdrawn from Orison and the platforms have once again returned to Crusader control. I promise you that we will redouble our efforts to stop the Nine Tails should anything like this ever happen again.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Failed_Mission_Orison_Siege_aAlly_tSystem_FromAlly_IG_002_AttentionThisIs=Attention, this is Rowena Dulli with the CDF. Nine Tails forces have vacated the platforms outside Orison. While CDF forces did their best to stop the criminals, their overall campaign was a failure.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_DestroyedVehicle_Siege_IG_001_IDontKnow=I don't know if the Nine Tails got you on their payroll or if you're just a lousy shot, but either way I can't afford to have you around destroying vehicles. You're off the mission.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_DestroyedVehicle_Siege_IG_003_WhatTheHell=What the hell are you doing? Those ships are a crucial part of our success. Anyone under my command needs to follow orders so consider yourself dismissed.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_KilledNeutral_Siege_IG_001_ThatWasA=That was a civilian you killed. I won't send psychos to fight psychos. You're done.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_KilledNeutral_Siege_IG_002_TheCdfIs=The CDF is here to protect the public, not kill them. You're gonna go down for what you did.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_KilledNeutral_Siege_IG_003_ICantBelieve=I can't believe you're as bad as the criminals we're supposed to stop. I've notified the authorities, but you're off my team.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_KilledPlayer_Siege_IG_001_HowTheHell=How the hell can you kill one of your own? You're lucky we have our hands full out here or I'd be dealing with you myself. Just know that the proper authorities have been notified. Now get the hell out of here.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_KilledPlayer_Siege_IG_002_DoYouHave=Do you have any idea what you just did? That was your ally! They trusted you! You're done with the CDF. I let the local authorities know where they can find you.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_KilledPlayer_Siege_IG_003_ICantBelieve=I can't believe you just did that. Killing another volunteer goes against everything the CDF stands for. I've let the authorities know, and I hope I never have to see you again.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_Siege_IG_001_WhatTheHell=What the hell are you doing? I can't have people under my command committing crimes. I'm cutting you loose until you get that sorted.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_Siege_IG_002_DulliHereYou=Dulli here. You can't be committing crimes while working for the CDF. Aside from the fact that it's just wrong, you could appear as a criminal to another volunteer and they could open fire. I'm pulling the contract from you until you clear your record.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Gained_CrimeStat_Siege_IG_003_WorkingForThe=Working for the CDF isn't an excuse to go commiting crimes. I'm kicking you from this mission until you get that sorted out.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Barge_Siege_FindBossIntel_IG_003_WordIsThat=Word is that Mendo Ren's carrying the access codes to these containers. You're gonna need to draw him out and take him down to get them.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_DefeatAA_FirstOccur_IG_001_AttentionAllCdf=Attention, all CDF volunteers. The Nine Tails are controlling each platform's anti-air defenses from an inverter hidden in one of the party supply crates. If you can get the access code, you can shut down the AA defenses directly.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_DefeatAA_FirstOccur_IG_002_GotSomeUseful=Got some useful news. The Nine Tails are controlling the AA defenses using devices stashed inside the Pressley's Party Supply crates. The Lieutenants on each platform will have the codes to access the containers. Could be easier than having to manually destroy each one.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_DefeatAA_FirstOccur_IG_003_AllRightEveryone=All right, everyone. We figured out how the Nine Tails are controlling the AA. They've stashed inverters inside party supply containers on each platform. Get the access code from the Lieutenant there and you shut them down.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindAltSolution_IG_001_LooksLikeAll=Looks like the shuttle controls are busted. You're going to have to find another way around.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindAltSolution_IG_002_ThoseShuttleControls=Those shuttle controls are jacked. You'll have to find another way.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindAltSolution_IG_003_NoWayYoure=No way you're getting those controls working. You'll need another way.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_FirstOccur_IG_001_AttentionItLooks=Attention, it looks like the Nine Tails might have used those Pressley's Party Supplies containers to bring some additional ammo and medical supplies in case they needed to restock. Looks like you'll have to find an access code to unlock it though.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_FirstOccur_IG_002_WeveBeenLooking=We've been looking into these containers from Pressley's Party Supplies and it turns out the company shut down years ago. Our current theory is that the Nine Tails used these to smuggle themselves and their supplies on to the platforms. Might be worth seeing if you can find a code to unlock the ones on this platform.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_FirstOccur_IG_003_GuessWhatTurns=Guess what? Turns out Pressley's Party Supplies doesn't exist anymore. I'm guessing whatever's inside these locked containers has something to do with the Nine Tails attack. If you can find the code to access them, could be useful to take a look inside.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_RepeatOccur_IG_001_WeNowKnow=We now know that Nine Tails lieutenants have the access codes for the Pressley's Party Supplies containers they smuggled in. If you want to access the ones on this platform, you'll have to deal with the lieutenant first.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_RepeatOccur_IG_002_IfTheseContainers=If these containers are anything like the ones on the other platform than you're going to have to get the code off the Lieutenant to open them. Might be worthwhile since the Nine Tails packed all sorts of useful things inside of them.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_RepeatOccur_IG_003_SeemsTheOnly=Seems the only way to open these Pressley's Party Supplies containers that the Nine Tails smuggled here is to get the code off the Lieutenant on this platform. Could be good to see if there's anything useful inside.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindIntel_FirstOccur_IG_001_WithTheLieutenant=With the lieutenant on this platform dealt with, it might be worthwhile to search their body and see if you can find any usable intel.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindIntel_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatThe=Now that the lieutenant on this platform has been neutralized, I'd suggest searching him for any possible intel. He might have something useful on him.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindIntel_FirstOccur_IG_003_TrySearchingThe=Try searching the body of this platform's lieutenant. Never know what useful intel he might have had on him.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Intro_MissionObj_Siege_FindTerminalCode_IG_001_NotTooMuch,P=Not too much of a surprise that they locked their system. Maybe see if you can find a code somewhere.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Intro_MissionObj_Siege_FindTerminalCode_IG_002_ShitLooksLike,P=Shit, looks like you need a code to access the terminal. You're gonna have to find it somewhere.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Intro_MissionObj_Siege_FindTerminalCode_IG_003_LockedYouMight,P=Locked... You might be able to find the access code somewhere.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_AAControls_Siege_IG_001_ThisLooksLike=This looks like a smaller version of the IFFI, but seems like it's dedicated to controlling this platform's anti-air defenses.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_AAControls_Siege_IG_002_PerfectYouFound=Perfect, you found the inverter that's controlling this platform's AA defenses. Shut it down.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_AAControls_Siege_IG_003_GreatThatInverter=Great, that inverter's controlling the anti-air on this platform. Shut it down to make the skies safe.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_BoobyTrap_Siege_IG_001_AttentionAllCdf=Attention, all CDF volunteers. Some of the Nine Tails containers have been trapped, so be careful when opening them.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_BoobyTrap_Siege_IG_002_BeAdvisedIm=Be advised. I'm getting reports that the Nine Tails have trapped some of their containers. Watch yourselves.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_BoobyTrap_Siege_IG_003_ThisIsDulli=This is Dulli. Listen up, looks like some of the Nine Tails containers have traps installed, so watch your step.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_HCMedSupplies_Siege_IG_003_WhatHaveWe=What have we got here? Looks like a bunch of meds.

NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_HCWeaponsAmmo_Siege_IG_001_NineTailsMust=Nine Tails must be using this container to load up on ammo.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_HCWeaponsAmmo_Siege_IG_002_LooksLikeYou=Looks like you found a Nine Tails ammo cache.
NEW	PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Open_MissionPOI_HCWeaponsAmmo_Siege_IG_003_TheyBroughtEnough=They brought enough ammo to go to war?

I mean I knew it was only a matter of time before they sent someone in to try and take these back, but I really thought Crusader would at least try themselves before begging rando civilians to throw away their lives instead of risking their own. Anyway, I'm gonna tell you what I told them. I got people on every platform who are more than capable of handling some weekend warrior CDF scags like you. I'll give you one chance to get back on that shuttle, otherwise you're fair game.
NEW	PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_002_WhyTheHell=Why the hell do the CDF have to come in and wreck some good old-fashioned chaos? I mean, we're not messing with you, so why the hell do you wanna risk your life for those chickenshits at Crusader who don't even have the sack to defend their own territory? Take a second and think it over, we can blast any ship that comes near us out of the sky. I've got heavy-hitters locking down each of the platforms. You don't stand a chance, so just take my advice; get back on the shuttle, go home, and pop a Pips. You'll live longer.
NEW	PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_003_CrusadersEvenMore=Crusader's even more pathetic than we thought to rely on civvies to save their ass. We control the skies around all these platforms so there ain't nobody getting close that ain't a friend of Nine Tails and each island is controlled by someone you really don't want to be messing with, so best thing you can do is get back on that shuttle. It ain't your problem.
NEW	PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_FirstThresh_IG_001_YouProbablyThink=You probably think you're making good progress so far. And yeah, maybe we started off underestimating you, but don't worry, that'll change.

NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IG_003,P=You know what this race is? This right here is some damn fine entertainment, if I do say so myself.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IG_004,P=Just wanna take a second to drop some real respect to our racers today. Not all of you may be that good or really have a shot at winning, but you still showed up and that says something.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_001,P=This race is turning into a real shooting gallery. Is there a sale on ammo or something?
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_002,P=This is some serious bloodlust happening right now. I ain't complaining though.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_003,P=Now, I'm not one to judge, but it feels like there are a lot of aggression issues being worked out right now.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_004,P=There's something about skilled pilots really going for each other's throats that just does it for me.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_001,P=Here we go. Last lap. It's now or never.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_002,P=This is the final lap right here. Time to ride or die, people.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_003,P=Final lap. Make it count.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Final_IG_004,P=Last lap. It's all or nothing.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_First_IG_001,P=First lap's done.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_First_IG_002,P=One lap done. Let's keep it going.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_First_IG_003,P=There we go. First lap done and done.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_001,P=That is another lap complete.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_002,P=That lap is done.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_003,P=Lap complete. Let's do it again.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_IG_004,P=Another lap finished.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_001,P=Our fearless leader just cleared another lap.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_002,P=This race is one lap closer to completion.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_003,P=Look at that. The head of the pack's onto a new lap.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_Leader_IG_004,P=The number one racer notched another lap.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_SingleRacer_IG_001,P=That's another lap complete for our lone surviving ship.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_SingleRacer_IG_002,P=And our one remaining competitor finishes another lap.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_LapComplete_SingleRacer_IG_003,P=With only one racer left, basically every lap they finish is a victory lap.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_001,P=Okay... looks like we got some assholes crashing our race.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_002,P=Seems we've got some uninvited guests screwing up our race.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_003,P=Heads up racers, looks like some blinders have decided to use you for target practice.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_001,P=Well, if I'm doing my math right, there's only one pilot left. So as long as they don't blow themselves up, the race is theirs.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_002,P=With only one survivor left, the finish is theirs for the taking. Piece of advice, don't get cocky. I've seen some crazy shit happen when people drop their guard.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_003,P=All right, we got good news and bad news. Good news for our last remaining pilot, you're all that's left, so you pretty much won. Bad news for everyone else who enjoys exciting races because... well see the good news. Someone wake me when they finish.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_Blowout_IG_001,P=This is getting to be a blowout. They are just dominating.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_Blowout_IG_002,P=If somebody doesn't step up soon, this race is over.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_Blowout_IG_003,P=Talk about an absolute beast. I don't know if anyone can catch them at this point.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_001,P=This is getting down to the wire. It's anybody's win for the taking now.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_002,P=Ooo, we got ourselves a real competition today. Don't know who's gonna snatch the prize.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_003,P=I tell you what. This is it right here. This is the kind of race you dream about. Whoever wins is really earning their keep, today.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_001,P=Getting close here. A little longer and it's gonna be all over. Question is, the rest of you just gonna let 'em win?
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_002,P=This could be it. We could be looking at a winner here. That is of course unless someone steps up and stops 'em.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_003,P=We headin' into the final moments of the race. If you've been biding your time, now might be the time to make your move.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_001,P=And our first racer is down. Was just a matter of time until things got real.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_002,P=Mark that as the first kill of the race.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_003,P=We got a casualty, folks. It's a fight now.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_004,P=Someone wanna call a medic? We got ourselves the first casualty.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_005,P=Ohhh, racer down! I don't think they're getting back up.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_001,P=Aaaand that's another racer down.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_002,P=And another racer bites the dust.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_003,P=Got another pilot merging with the infinite.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_004,P=Another one down. We're getting into a downright brawl here.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_005,P=Y'all see that fool go down? Damn they got lit up.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_001,P=[ Laughing ] Oh, damn. I bet they thought they were gonna win.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_002,P=Oh! They thought they were on top! That they were untouchable, but that dream came crashing down.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_003,P=One second they're in the lead, and the next they're a flaming wreck. That's life for ya.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_001,P=Kill the leader, become the leader. There can be only one!
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_002,P=Cycle of life here, people. It's all about killing your way to the top.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_003,P=Not only did that racer just kill their way into first place, but they did it with serious style.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_001,P=Um... a pilot just left in the middle of the race. What's the point of starting something you ain't gonna finish?
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_002,P=One of our racers just up and quit... That's a bit dissapointing.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_003,P=Seems one of our pilots ran away. Hope no one was betting on them.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_004,P=Did y'all see that pilot leave? Thought it went without saying, but don't leave in the middle of a race.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_001,P=First checkpoint down. Let's see if they can make it two.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_002,P=First one's down. We're off, people.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_003,P=Alright, alright. Here we go. First checkpoint.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_001,P=Checkpoint taken.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_002,P=Look at that, another checkpoint down.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_003,P=A pilot just snagged another checkpoint.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_004,P=Another chekpoint taken. NIcely done.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_005,P=Checkpoint claimed. That's what I like to see.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_006,P=There we go. Give that pilot a point.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_001,P=Looks like we got ourselves a new leader.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_002,P=This ain't over yet. New leader's stepping up.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_003,P=Hoowee, there's a new boss in town.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_001,P=And checkpoint. Not a real surprise there.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_002,P=(snore interrupted) Huh? What happened? Oh...
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_003,P=One last racer, one more point.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_001,P=Get ready. Here comes the next marker.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_002,P=Ready up! New marker inbound.

NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_004,P=Another marker incoming. Get ready.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_005,P=Hold on, got a new maker on it's way.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_006,P=Okay y'all, new marker's about to drop.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_NewCheckpoint_IG_007,P=Here comes the next marker.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_WrongWay_IG_001,P=I'm normally in favor of an independent streak, but flying the wrong direction is a bit much.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_WrongWay_IG_002,P=Not sure if you just missed the signs, but you're heading the wrong way.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_WrongWay_IG_003,P=Not sure what "race enhancers" you're on, but you're flying the wrong direction.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_High_IG_001,P=That is it! It's all over! We have a winner!
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_High_IG_002,P=And it's official, we have ourselves a winner!
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_High_IG_003,P=Stick a fork in it! We have a winner!
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_Low_IG_001,P=And that's that. To the winner: Congrats. To everyone else: practice.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_Low_IG_002,P=And... we're done. All right, let's get ready for the next one. Okay?
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_Low_IG_003,P=That'll do it. Helluva show from our winner... probably too good of one if you ask me. But nice work.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_001,P=I'll see you next time, ladies and germs. Remember, keep the throttle down and your eyes open. Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a bottle of Rust with my name on it.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_002,P=Like to thank everyone listening. Keep at it and maybe next time it'll be you in the winner's circle. This is Nas Calloway signing off. Now if you'll excuse me. I gotta take a leak. Later.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_003,P=Whew! Don't know about you but I am wiped. Before I head out, a shout out to our new champ and a big thanks to everyone else for making them look so damn good. This is Nas Calloway. I'll see y'all at the next one.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_004,P=That's it for me. Win or lose, hope you all had as much fun as I did. Though I'm guessing it's a lot more fun if you win. If you come back and race again, maybe you'll get to find out for yourself. 'Til then, keep it tight.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_005,P=Let me be the first to say congrats to our victor. And to all the others, hopefully, I'll see you all back here again real soon. It's been a trip.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_001,P=Seems one of our racers had a change of heart and ghosted. But hey, there's always other fish in the sea, right?
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_002,P=Well, we're down a entrant now. Guess some people can't handle the pressure. Screw it. Race's probably better off without 'em, anyway.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_MinRacersAccepted_IG_001,P=What's up, people. Looks like we got enough racers to make this official. Now we just need people to show up and we can get this show on the road.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_MinRacersAccepted_IG_002,P=Quick update, ladies and germs. We got enough racers to make this interesting. Once all our people show up, we go.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_MinRacersAccepted_IG_003,P=Got word from on high that the race ticket's filling up. I expect they'll be making their way over here any time now. Lookin' at the list... yeah, I think this'll be good.

NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceCanceled_IG_001,P=That's it. I'm calling it. Race is canceled. No point in doing this if no one else is coming. Maybe next time.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceCanceled_IG_002,P=Alright, look. I hate to do it, but I got a bunch of pilots who bailed, so it looks like we're gonna have to race some other time.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_001,P=Actually, I might kick this off a little early.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_002,P=I'll be honest, I'm kinda eager to get this show on the road.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_003,P=It's looking like we might be all set to go. Just gonna do a last count...
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_001,P=Stay frosty, y'all. Shouldn't be too much longer now.

NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_002,P=Hey there, rambler. Welcome to the heat. Bet you're itching to get started, but I'm gonna need you to just sit tight 'til the rest of the racers show.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_003,P=Hey, glad you could make it. More food for the fodder, right? As soon as the rest of the pack shows, we'll get going, but 'til then just stay close and be ready.

NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Normal_IG_001,P=Okay. Everyone's at the starting line, so it's almost go time. Here's the rub. To win, you gotta be first to finish all the laps. Tricky part is all the other racers trying to do the same. Make sense?
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Normal_IG_002,P=Looks like we got all our racers in place so let me tell you how this is gonna work. The first ship to complete all the laps wins. Easy as pie.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Normal_IG_003,P=Alright, ramblers, let's get rambling. Y'all know the drill, the racer that finishes all the laps first wins. Should be a real good time.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Scramble_IG_001,P=Alright, listen up. Now that everyone's here, lemme lay out the rules. Y'all are gonna be racing in a scramble. First one to collect enough checkpoints wins. Outside of that, do whatever the hell you want.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Scramble_IG_002,P=We're good to go, people. Now the race of the day is what's called a scramble. First one to collect enough checkpoints wins. Anyone get's in your way? Do what you gotta do to get them out of your way.
NEW	PU_RACEANN1_AN_RaceStart_RaceModeExp_Scramble_IG_003,P=Attention all pilots, we're about to get underway. Now, today's race has two rules: 1. Be the first to collect enough checkpoints. 2. Stop other people from collecting checkpoints. Simple, right?

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_001_IfYouWanna=If you wanna talk fast, this speedster can hold her own. The throttle pretty much accelerates by itself.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_002_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for speed, then you're looking in the right place. You should hear this baby purr when she gets going.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_002_TheySayYou=They say you can't put a price on safety. I say bullshit. Not only did we put a price on it, we put a great price on it. Protection per credit, you're not gonna find much better than this.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_001_IDontKnow=I don't know about you, but I can always use some more storage room. That's why this ship is perfect. Plenty of SCU and then some.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_85X_IG_001_IllBeHonest=You know a lot of the younger people who come in here are interested in the 100. And I mean, why not? Origin comfort wrapped up in a sporty, fun chasis. I see the appeal myself.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Arrow_IG_001_IveTalkedTo=I've talked to some of the ex-Navy who come in here about the Arrow. Well, to tell the truth, it's more like they talk to me about it. Can't say enough good things. Seems the light fighter makes one hell of a scout ship.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Aurora_IG_001_ConsideringAnAurora=Considering an Aurora, huh? I like that. People are so eager to over complicate things that they forget that basic doesn't mean bad. The Aurora flies and gets you where you're going. Sounds like the perfect ship to me.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Avenger_IG_001_TheresAReason=There's a reason the Advocacy's been counting on Avengers for so long. Few ships can match its operational flexibility. The thing's an icon.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Blade_IG_001_ShesAKiller=She's a killer, isn't she? It's like the Vanduul took a Scythe and shaved it down till all that was left was the bite.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Buccaneer_IG_001_TheBuccsA=The Bucc's a great little fighter. You toss one into any scrap and suddenly its a whole new game. Cutlass coming at you, you can handle it. Cutlass and a Bucc, forget about it.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Carrack_IG_001_ICouldPretty=I could pretty much talk all day about the Carrack, but I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna let the ship speak for itself.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Caterpillar_IG_001_CaterpillarsGotA=Caterpillar's got a ton of storage, and Drake was thoughtful enough to give it few ways to protect it. Plus, I always get a weird thrill when a ship looks like its name.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_TheCrucibleIs=The Crucible is some pretty incredible engineering. Thing is basically a flying toolbox. They can fix up most problems a pilot can run into. If that's not a great skill to have, don't know what is.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_SolidOffenseDecent=Solid offense, decent defense, not too shabby of a hold, easy to take care of, and an interesting reputation to say the least. A lot of people think the Cutlass is a great investment, and I'm tempted to agree.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_TheNewTumbril=The new Tumbril really outdid themselves with the Cyclone. I had an old homesteader in just the other week telling me that she had been riding in one of the originals for decades, and didn't once think about giving it up until she saw the new ones. Not only did she buy the new one, but she told me that she's gonna keep the old one on her porch just to sit in. How about that?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Dragonfly_IG_001_TheDragonflyIs=The Dragonfly is less of a ship and more of a lifestyle.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Eclipse_IG_001_OhIsThere=Oh, is there an Eclipse here? Thing's so stealthy I almost didn't notice it. Just kidding with ya. But seriously, thing's as silent of a predator as they come.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Endeavor_IG_001_TheEndeavorIs=The Endeavor is less of a ship and more of a roaming university. It's all a little bit beyond me, if I'm being honest, but I have it on good authority that if you're in the market for a scientific vessel, this is the one you want.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_F8Lightning_IG_001_ILoveThat=I love that we have an F8 for sale. I remember when these monsters were for the military only. Just look at the thing. Is that a killer or what? Let's see someone try to mess with you when you're flying one of these.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Freelancer_IG_001_IThinkOver=I think over the years, I've sold more Freelancers than just about anything else. I think it's cause MISC made them real jack of all trades. Plus, they really hold on to their resale value.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Genesis_IG_001_JustBetweenMe=Just between me and you, I've always wanted to own a Genesis. I flew on one with my dad when I was ten. We were going to visit my grandmother, and I don't think I had ever been on a ship that big or fancy before. Since then, there's always been a part of me that wonders what it would be like to be a commercial transport pilot. But maybe you buy this one, and then you can come back and tell me what it's like.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_TheGladiIs=The Gladi is a fascinting bit of hardware. For being so streamlined, it carries some serious ordnance. Almost like a light heavy.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsFast=Gladius is fast, it's maneuverable, and as all the old timers say, it definitely punches above its weight class.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_PeopleAreAlways=People are always eager to point out that a Glaive is just a Scythe with two blades, but it is so much more than that. You know the Vanduul clans only let the most dangerous and experienced pilots fly a Glaive?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_YouKnowWhat=You know what I've always wondered about the Hammerhead? Do you think they came up with the name first and made the ship match, or the other way around? Either way, it's one of the best patrol ships flying today.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_TheHawkIs=The Hawk is what I recommend to any bounty hunter who comes in. It's got the speed you need to run someone down, and guns to spare once you catch up with them.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_TheHeraldIs=The Herald is definitely one of the more interesting ships we have on the lot. It's not every data runner that comes with its own broadcast array.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a hauler, you can't go wrong with a Hull. They were built to handle cargo, and damn if they don't do a good job of it.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_YouKnowIn=You know in Sataball when you sail one to a teammate and they just tap it in, no problem? The Hurricane is the ship version of that. One of you is flying, the other is on the turret, and together you are just taking care of business.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureActually=If you're actually in the market for something of this size and power, the Idris is a class all its own. She may not be cheap, but would you trust a cheap frigate?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_TheKhartuStands=The Khartu stands out for a lot of reasons, but those crazy Xi'an stairs alone make it a must buy.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_TheKrakenFollows=The Kraken follows Drake's mantra of why do one thing well when you could do fifty. I've heard of them being used as mini carriers for militias. I've heard of them being used as mobile shopping plazas. Heck, I even heard of one guy who turned the whole thing into some sort of crazy night club. Not that I'm recommending that last one.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IfIHad=If I had it my way, I would be out there flying this bad boy myself. I mean look at those thrusters. The M50 is just begging to be flown.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_YouRememberThe=You remember the Mustang commercial? Where risk meets reward? Well, Consolidated took all the risk, and we get all the reward of being able to fly them. Bottom line is that they are just a fun ship to fly.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_WhatABeast=What a beast, right? You think about the war history on these Nova tanks, and it's amazing that you can just walk into a shop these days and buy one yourself.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nox_IG_001_ApparantlyAopoaHad=Apparantly, Aopoa had to modify the Nox for Humans. I guess when Xi'an pilot them, they're bodies naturally enhance the aerodynamics. Our weird Human bodies threw everything out of whack, so they had to reconfigure a lot of things to get it just right for us.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Orion_IG_001_CanYouBelieve=Can you believe that the Orion is a ship that actually flies, and not just some kind of mining station? I mean look at the size of the thing.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P52Merlin_IG_001_TheP52Is=The P-52 is a great little scrapper to have around to help in a fight. Nimble. Smaller frame which means its harder to hit. And it's easy on the eyes which never hurts.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_TheArchimedesIs=The Archimedes is the Merlin's more sophisticated sibling. Everything that makes the P-52 so great but a little bit extra sprinkled on top. Definitely would not be out of place if you take it out to the track.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Pioneer_IG_001_DidYouWatch=Did you watch when Silas Koerner introduced these back at the '47 CitizenCon? Seemed like a pipe dream that a ship could just roll up and start spitting out outposts. Crazy genius did it though, right?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to upgrade a militia, the Polaris is a no-brainer. It's got the torpedos. It's got the small craft bay. Vanduul see one of these patrolling a system, and chances are those gullets are running for the nearest jump point.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_HeresTheGreat=Here's the great thing about the Prospector: you go out there and find the right spot to mine, the ship will basically pay for itself.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_TheReliantIsnt=The Reliant isn't any old ordinary ship. MISC shoved the thing just chockablock with Xi'an tech. The way it rotates around feels like something out of a sci-fi spec vid.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_ImPrettySure=I'm pretty sure every captain out there shakes a bit in their boots when they see a Tali drawing near. This is a bomber desinged to inspire fear. The thing was pretty much made to chew through cap ships.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_AegisReallyGot=Aegis really got it right when they were building the Sabre. It's light, but it still has enough going on that it can hold it's own. My only complaint is that the name is a bit close to a Cutlass. I keep having people come in who are confused about which one is which. Not sure how that's possible, but there you go.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_ItMayNot=It may not seem like the obvious choice, but let me tell you, you show up to a fight in one of these badass Xi'an warrior rigs and you are making a bold statement right there my friend.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_IJustLearned=I just learned a little while ago that Terrapin is a kind of turtle. How much more sense does that name make now? You know like how the ship has all this heavy armor plating just like a turtle shell?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_UsraRover_IG_001_DidYouKnow=Did you know that most new planets found are first explored with the help of an Ursa? They're such a tough and durable rover that it's a natural pick.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_ThisThingIs=This thing is less of a ship and more of a mobile fortress. With its heavy armor, you can deliver a full squad of pain and hurt to just about anywhere that needs an ass whoopin.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_ThisIsThe=This is the ship you want if you're looking to get into the salvaging game. Plus, you got to admit, the Vulture is just a great name for a ship.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_FighterPilotsAlways=Fighter pilots always think they're the heroes, but when it comes right down to it, wouldn't you rather have a ship that can deliver real stopping power like this bomber can?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_IfYouDo=If you do any mercenary work or you're just worried about security, than a fighter like this is a great way to put your mind at ease. Good offense is the best defense, right?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Data_IG_001_JustTheOther=Just the other week I was watching Kaizen on the spec, and they were going on about how data is gonna be the future. Seems like this would be the perfect time to get data ship of your own.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_IAlwaysHear=I always hear people talking about space superiority, but for my credits, you're gonna want some boots on the ground.

You'll never feel as appreciated as you do when you top off someone who moments before had been stuck on the drift. Ships like this are the real lifeblood of the 'verse.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Industrial_IG_001_AtTheEnd=At the end of the day, what you really want to know is, can this ship get the job done? And if you're lucky enough to be her new owner, I think you'll know that answer soon enough.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Luxury_IG_001_TheWayI=The way I see it, with as much time as you're gonna spend on board your ship, it really is worth it make sure that you travel in comfort.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_ItImpressesMe=It impresses me to no end to think about all the brave men and women out there, risking their lives to help save the lives of others. Takes a real special kind of person to fly a medical ship, no doubt about that.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's great? No matter what the government's doing, who the military's fighting, what system you're in, there's always one constant. People are gonna need resources.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Support_IG_001_CannotExpressHow=Cannot express how happy it makes me every time I get to sell a ship like this.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_MannedTurret_IG_001_ThisOnesAlso=This one's also got a manned turret, which if you ask me, raises the value ten-fold. I'd rather have a dedicated turret gunner than someone playing a video game remotely.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Missiles_IG_001_ThisOneComes=This one comes fully stocked with missiles. Nothing changes the tone of a battle faster than guidance-locked ordnance, am I right?

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_SingleSeat_IG_001_ThisOnesFor=This one's for a solo pilot. It's a little bit more work as you have a lot more to pay attention to, but I find there's something satisfying about flying solo.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_VTOL_IG_001_YouveProbablyNoticed=You've probably noticed the VTOL thrusters on this. They'll give you ultra-precise maneuvering when navigating around a landing pad. And require a lot less room to take off.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Anvil_IG_001_ThereArentMany=There aren't many manufacturers that have the rep that Anvil ships have. From what I hear, they run every design through a rigorous internal review process before even starting production to make sure the ship is exactly what they want to make. Pretty impressive when you think about it.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Aopoa_IG_001_TheXianMake=The Xi'an make interesting ships, I'll give them that. You don't really see lines like this in Human construction.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_ConsolidatedOutlands_IG_001_ForMyMoney=For my money, there's no ship manufacturer doing more exciting things than Consolidated Outlands. Silas Koerner's a true visionary. Ships like this are just proof of that.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Crusader_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the things I like about Crusader ships is that they aren't flashy. They aren't trying to redefine the wheel. They're just creating good ships and creating them well.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Drake_IG_001_YouKnowPeople=You know, people like to give Drake a hard time about the fact that some criminals like to use their ships, but I'll be honest, I've seen outlaws in every kind of ship imaginable. Doesn't change the fact that Drake makes good ships.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_MISC_IG_001_IKnowRsi=I know RSI usually gets the credit for building ships for regular people, but if you ask me, it's MISC. I mean, think about it, look at all the industrial ships they've constructed, how engrained they are with hauling, mining, even racing now. I don't know, MISC seems to be making a run for the title.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_OriginJumpworks_IG_001_IDontNeed=I don't need to say anything, right? I mean, an Origin ship is an Origin ship. Just take a moment, look at that. You know what I mean.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_RSI_IG_001_YouCanNever=You can never really go wrong with an RSI ship. It's not the most exciting sales pitch, but it's true. They've pushed innovation for centuries. You don't get to do that if you're making crap.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Tumbril_IG_001_LookingForSome=Looking for some terrestrial technology? Tumbril's a good brand. Though they just relaunched, the tech's been around forever. I guess why fix what isn't broken.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_004_IllLeaveYou=I'll leave you to it. Always find it's best to sit back, take in the space and let your ship call to you.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_004_IMeanIts=I mean it's a lot of credits, sure, but what do you really have to think about?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_001_TheresNothingWrong=There's nothing wrong with buying used, you know. Every single one of mine I've bought secondhand. At least you know it's not gonna blow up the first time you turn it on.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_002_IDontKnow=I don't know why you wouldn't buy used. Sure you don't get the bragging rights of saying it's brand new, but you ask me, used ships got more character.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_003_HonestlyIfIt=Honestly if it were up to me, I'd charge more for used ships. They've been out there. Tested. You know they can deliver. New ships? They got nice paint jobs.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_001_IllLevelWith=I'll level with you. If you're looking to go slow, you need to walk away from this one right here. It's almost a psychological condition. You start up this monster, you'll be peeling metal.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_003_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, I could hit you with stats, figures, hull compression strength or whatever, but honestly, the decision's been made. You knew from the moment you looked at her.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_001_LookingForA=Looking for a transport? You could do a lot worse than this one. Plenty of open space for hauling whatever the hell you want.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_002_OneOfThe=One of the great things about this baby here is space. If you're looking to haul, you can't go wrong with this model. I used this very ship to help move my parents into their new home. One of the easiest moves I've ever made.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_100Series_IG_001_YourEntryInto=Your entry into the world of Origin ships, but don't let that fool you. The 100s got all the excellence and design of its bigger brothers.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Arrow_IG_001_YouWannaKeep=You wanna keep it fast and light. The Arrow's your ship. Anvil built her as a combat alternative to the Gladius. Were they successful? Depends on who you ask, maybe you can tell me where you land on it.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Aurora_IG_001_PeopleLikeTo=People like to sleep on the Aurora. Sure, you line it up against all the other ships in the 'verse and yeah, maybe it's a little weak, but I'll tell you this. I still fly mine every day. How many ships can you say that about?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Avenger_IG_001_YouGottaLove=You gotta love Avengers. For the longest time, everybody would immediately mistake you for a cop when you flew by. Still do in some parts of the Empire probably.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Blade_IG_001_TheVanduulLight=The Vanduul light fighter, lovingly... is that the right phrase? Anyway, created by the artists over at Esperia. This thing's light, it's nimble and a pitch perfect recreation of the original Vanduul design.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Buccaneer_IG_001_YouTalkTo=You talk to most dogfighters and they'll swear Aegis or Anvil up and down the show, but here's the thing. This bad boy right here is a born scrapper. You got a handful of guns at your disposal and enough speed to keep you out of someone's crosshairs. The rest is up to skill.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Carrack_IG_001_ImNotSure=I'm not sure if you're one of those who hear the call of the unknown, who have that gnawing desire to discover, to see what lies beyond. If that's you, than this... this is what you want at your side.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Caterpillar_IG_001_ImpressiveIsntShe=Impressive, isn't she? Asymmetrical hull design. Multiple cargo compartments to maximize your capacity. Even some crew living quarters for long runs. You know this ship design is almost a hundred years old? It just goes to show that ships don't have to be pretty to be innovative.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Constellation_IG_001_MyBrotherUsed=My brother used to say that he'd only really feel like a success if he could buy a Constellation. That, to him, was the pinnacle of space travel. To be fair, it's a helluva ship.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_IllAdmitI=I'll admit, I was a little surprised to hear that Anvil was doing a repair ship. I guess blowing ships up gives you a pretty solid understanding of how to put them back together.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_EverybodysGotAn=Everybody's got an opinion on the Cutlass. This was the ship that basically put Drake on the map. Gets a bad rap these days, but I don't know. At the end of the day, the ship's versatile, easy to maintain and affordable. None of that sounds bad to me.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_CyclonesHaveBeen=Cyclones have been racing around for hundreds of years. Like I always say, if there's something I gotta do planetside, a Cyclone can help pull it off.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_AnvilsGladiatorA=Anvil's Gladiator. A lotta people tend to right this bad boy off as a single-function ship. Good at dropping ordnance and not much else. But they forget that it's a multi-seater with a turret and some decent guns.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsA=Gladius is a bonafide classic. I guarantee you walk up to any person, old or young, and they can pick this ship out of a lineup immediately. It's fought in wars, defended homesteads, everything. The Gladius is the dogfighter by which all dogfighters are measured.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_YouWatchThe=You watch the Lost Squad? This is the exact type of ship that... oh what's his name... that Vanduul commander. I can never pronounce it. Anyway, this is what he flies. It's the variant of the Scythe that they give to their aces. Anyway, you should check out the show. It's pretty great.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_AhTheHammerhead=Ah, the Hammerhead. Not sure if you've ever seen one of these throw down, but... let's just say wow. It's one of those cap ships that's designed to handle fighters. Anyway, when this thing's firing all barrels, Navy pilots used to call it the Bloom of Death. Cool, right?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_AnotherPopularStarter=Another popular starter ship, the Hawk here's been increasingly popular with amateur bounty hunters or anyone who needs to chase people down and shoot at them.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_DrakesDataRunner=Drake's data runner is basically the answer to the question of what happens if you strap a cockpit onto a thruster. Not great on turns, but when you're going that fast, who cares.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_WhenYouOnly=When you only care about cargo space and nothing else. No frills. No amenities. Just cargo. There is a Hull for you.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_SpeedAndGuns=Speed and guns. A lethal combination in the right hands. You'll need it too. See the Hurricane here... well, to put it bluntly, isn't the sturdiest of ships. In a nutshell, it's a lot better at dishing out punishment than taking it. Not that I'm trying to dissuade you, just that you should know before buying.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking into buying a frigate, I might have to close early today. Aegis' Idris has been the go-to for everybody from the UEE Navy to megacorps. Show up in one of these and I guarantee you make an impression.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_ThisOneWas=This one was the first ship Aopoa was allowed to sell in the UEE. A modification of the Xi'an military's light fighter, the Khartu'al is agile and surgical.

A customer of mine, who's very satisfied with this purchase, referred to it as the Human equivalent of the Merchantman. I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was a funny analogy.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IHopeYou=I hope you aren't allergic to speed. It's damn near impossible to keep a beast like the m50 in anything remotely resembling a reasonably safe speed.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mercury_IG_001_TheCrusaderReps=The Crusader Reps hate it when I call the Mercury a blockade runner. They think it's implying that it was built for illegal use, but I think it's a compliment. You want to move some cargo or got a courier job but you gotta do it with speed, agility, and pack a nice punch? Mercury's got your back.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a versatile starter ship, I personally recommend the Mustang. Silas Koerner's a personal hero of mine and what he's done with this ship is really something.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_AnotherBangerFrom=Another banger from Tumbril, the Nova is a modern update of the classic battle tank. This thing can shred targets on the ground or in the air. The main cannon is absolutely deafening. It's pretty cool.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_IllBeHonest=I'll be honest, I love taking this baby out for a little spin during breaks. Not this one here, we got another in the back, but seriously, if you're looking for something short-range, the P72 is where it's at. Hands down.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_PTVBuggy_IG_001_ThisLittleBuggy=This little buggy is just what it is. No frills. Dependable and fun as hell to drive. Buddy of mine used to build race tracks for them.

It's opening up planetary settlement in really exciting ways.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_PartOfRsis=Part of RSI's larger capital ship skunkworks, the Polaris is a corvette-class combat vessel.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_ThereAreSome=There are some who say the Prospector's just a starter ship. That it's for amateurs, but here's the rub. Sure, it's not taking down massive hauls, but it's for people who like to work.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prowler_IG_001_EsperiaGotSome=Esperia got some ridiculous access to an original Tevarin model to create this line of replicas. You ask me, this looks like something out of a Spec vid. Back in the war, they'd use these to drop boarders on capital ships. How nuts is that?
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Razor_IG_001_WhenMiscAnnounced=When MISC announced they were jumping into the racing game, I was like 'what?! no way.' but the second you fire up the engines on this puppy... you put away your doubts.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Redeemer_IG_001_TheRedeemerWas=The Redeemer was a bit of an experiment for Aegis, but the gunship has definitely found some supporters in the private contractor arena. You ask me, it's because of those rotating nacelles.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_MiscsReliantIf=MISC's Reliant. If there's anything that signifies how far our relationship with the Xi'an has come, it's this ship. Hell, the damn thing turns vertical like one of theirs.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, if you need to absolutely bomb something into last week. You need a Retaliator. They been doing it for hundreds of years.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_NowThisThis=Now this, this is a fun ship. While you've got the Hornet for brawling, the Sabre's a more elegant alternative. Fast and precise lethality. I came up with that.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_AopoasReallyUpping=Aopoa's really upping their game in the UEE markets, the San... San'tak... however you pronounce it is supposed to be a scrapper through and through.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Scythe_IG_001_VanduulScytheProbably=Vanduul Scythe. Probably the most known fighter in their armada. This one here? This was captured from a Vanduul defector in Orion. I'm kidding, it's a repro made by Esperia. Looks pretty convincing, right?

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_TheTerrapinHere=The Terrapin here, it's got a real interesting history, but you aren't here about history, right? If you want to push out beyond the reach of civilization, search for the new, then this is the ship for you.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_BeforeIStart=Before I start talking, just take a moment and breathe in this ship. <pause> Anvil's Valkyrie. Designed as a heavy troop transport, it's armed, it's armored, it's a killer.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vanguard_IG_001_YeahTheVanguard=Yeah, the Vanguard here's one of the newer ones from Aegis. They'd had some older heavy fighters back in the day, but they went back to the drawing board with this one to create something thoroughly modern and undeniably deadly.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulcan_IG_001_AegisVulcanSmall=Aegis' Vulcan. Small, mobile refuel and rearm ship. It's perfect for do-gooder types and budding entrepreneurs.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_LookingToCrack=Looking to crack into the salvage game? I don't blame you. There's some good money in it.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_BeCarefulIm=Be careful! I'm just kidding. This bad boy's a devastator though. Capable of delivering ordnance with surgical precision.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_WellIfYoure=Well, if you're looking to tear it up with somebody, you could do a lot worse than this one here. This one's a surefire, Grade-A certified brawler.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_WhatYoureLooking=What you're looking at here is a combat juggernaut. It's got firepower, sure. Armor, check. But it's really designed to punch through defenses and deliver troops. Here's the thing though, dropships like this aren't only good for dropping people off, they make excellent extraction ships too.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Exploration_IG_001_IAlwaysAdmired=I always admired people who wanted to explore the universe. I'm too much of a homebody. Take me away from anytime food delivery and spectrum feeds and I lose my mind.

NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_WeDontHave=We don't have a lot of medical ships and to be honest, I'm not as schooled about them, but I've heard good things about this one. Paramedic from Ferron came through last week and gave me the run down.
NEW	PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_MyOldMan=My old man was a miner. Sixty years sledging rock on planets, asteroids, you name it, he cracked it.

At Red Wind, as long as you got the credits we'll take whatever to wherever. Understand?\n\nIf that sounds good to you, let's see how you do on this run -\n\nPACKAGES FOR PICK UP (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup3|Address)\n\nDROP OFF LOCATIONS (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff3|Address)\n\nOne last bit of advice, it would probably be good to avoid any unnecessary delays once you got the packages onboard, for example being searched by local law enforcement. \n

The gravity generator's going to need a complete overhaul to get it working again, and that means we need to park up in a garage for a few days. \n\nSince I know we’re not going to do that until this job's done, and there’s a good chance the gravity's going to keep fritzing out on us which is less than ideal, so in the meanwhile, I went ahead and rigged the engineering console to allow anybody to do a hard reset of the system if they need to.\n\nFigure at least this way if I'm gunked up patching another part of the ship you all don't have to wait for me.\n\n-Judy\n

I'm guessing he's as good as ghosted, but I want you to head to the Pride of Arliss and try to get my data off the captain's personal datapad.\n\nOnce you have it, I set up a secure transmission channel at the ARC-L1 rest stop.

NEW	Tut01_Journal01_GettingStarted_Content=Welcome to Star Citizen!\n\nYou have just stepped 930 years into a future where Humanity has spread across the stars under the rule of the United Empire of Earth (the UEE). While many Humans spend their lives never leaving their homeworld, there are those who choose to travel aboard advanced starships, braving outlaws, hostile aliens, and hazardous conditions to seek their fortune.  \n\nCurrently, you are in Area18, on ArcCorp, the third planet in the Stanton System – a great distance from Humanity’s origins in the Sol System. The four planets in the system are owned by megacorporations who each purchased a planet from the UEE and now govern their own region of space. They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\nArea18 is the main commercial zone of the mega-city that sprawls across the surface of ArcCorp. From here, the tutorial will guide you to Baijini Point, the space station in orbit above the planet that can serve as your gateway to further exploration of the Stanton system.

NEW	Tut01_Journal02_TheBasics_Content=The universe of Star Citizen is a dynamic place, providing players with the ability to interact with much of the environment around them. The foundation of this ability is the game’s Interaction Mode. \n\nIf you are in range to interact with an object – like a door or item of food – it will be highlighted blue and a number of options will appear, defining the various ways you can interact with that item. The option you are currently selecting will be highlighted in a brighter color than the other options. \n\nYou can also Quick Interact with objects to do the main action associated with it. For example, Quick Interacting with a closed door will open it. It'll also pick up an item, loot a container, and switch lights on or off.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to zoom in or zoom out on objects you’re looking at. When interacting with an interface, you can also scroll through the list of available options on the display. For example, you can scroll through the list of floor options while interacting with an elevator panel.\n\nFor all manners of interaction, you may prefer to use different keybinds. To view all the current keybinds or adjust them, use the Keybinding tab of the Options menu.

NEW	Tut02_Journal01_Trading_Content=The universe of Star Citizen has many unique pieces of equipment and clothing for you to use. These items may be looted from adversaries but can also be purchased from the numerous stores around the ‘verse. Specialized stores at major landing zones tend to have the necessary stock to cover your basic needs, whereas quieter areas might have unique variants or niche equipment.\n\nTo buy an item on display, approach it and enter Interaction Mode. The brand logo, item name, and price will be displayed, as well as options to BUY, TRY ON, or INSPECT the item. If you like what you see and have the necessary funds, selecting the BUY option will open your mobiGlas so you can complete the purchase.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to browse the shopping kiosks. While these kiosks are not as hands-on, it is easier to buy goods in volume through the kiosk interfaces. Kiosks also give you the option to choose where the items will be delivered – either to your local storage or directly to your personal inventory.\n\nTo sell items, first make sure that they are in your personal inventory, local storage, or are cargo on a vehicle stored at that location. Then you can interact with a shopping kiosk at a store and use the “SELL” tab. From there you will be given options to select which items you wish to sell. Not all stores will purchase all items.\n\nPERSONAL INVENTORY\nYour Personal Inventory is the storage on your character. You can use this screen to arrange and organize your items, transferring them between your Personal Inventory and Local Storage or equipping them to your character. Take note that certain items have requirements for when they can be equipped, such as armor needing to be placed on an undersuit. All inventories have a capacity bar near the top that indicates how much they can store. \n\nLOCAL STORAGE\nYour Local Storage is unique to the current zone you are in. For example, if you are on microTech you will no longer have access to your Area18 storage. While Local Storages are significantly larger than Personal Inventories, they still have their own maximum capacity.\n\nAs you accumulate a high number of items, you can use the tabs at the top of the Local Inventory window to filter through specific categories of items and equipment.\n\nVehicles also have their own storage capacity. This inventory is not shared with any other players aboard and remains accessible to you while onboard the vehicle or while that vehicle is parked at your current landing zone.\n\nLOSING ITEMS\nRemember, when you get into dangerous situations out in the ‘verse you risk losing your items! Things in your personal inventory at the time of your death will remain on your corpse and will need to be retrieved. The same is true when a vehicle is destroyed. There is a chance that other players will find and claim your lost items before you can.\n\nAnything in storage at a major city landing zone is safe regardless of what happens to you or your vehicles.

NEW	Tut03_Part02_Journal01_ShipFlightBasics_Content=Congratulations!\n\nYou’ve completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the universe! \n\nNow it’s up to you decide what your life in space will be like. The Contract Manager on your mobiGlas contains many different opportunities for you to pursue from simple delivery missions to dangerous criminal jobs. Work hard and you can build your reputation with different organizations to gain access to more rewarding contracts. Whether you choose to live a life of crime or hunt down bounties and enforce the law, it is up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’d rather forge your own path, feel free to use the StarMap in the mobiGlas and explore all the Stanton system has to offer. From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. Wherever your next steps take you, safe flying!\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT\nIf you’re interested in practicing flying or experiencing combat without risking your ship, Star Citizen features an arcade mode called ‘Arena Commander’ as an option in the game’s main menu.\n\nMOBIGLAS\nYour mobiGlas personal computer features a variety of functions and apps essential to life in the ‘verse.  Below is a list of all the apps, listed in the order they appear, that are accessible via the icons at the bottom of your mobiGlas.\n\n_______________________________________\nMOBIGLASS APPS\n\nHome – Displays information about your personal status including your health and how many credits you have to your name.\n\nCommlink – Shows chat channels, friends, and pending invites to the party system. Create a party, invite other players, or send friend requests here. You can also activate or deactivate proximity-based voice chat from this app.\n\nVehicle Loadout Manager – Customized the loadout, including components or paints, for any vehicle you own that are stored at your current local location. Components you wish to use must be in your local inventory.\n\nNikNax – Locate any assets you have stored across the 'verse. Selecting an asset will provide added details.\n\nSkyline – Access the StarMap set Quantum Travel routes by selecting a location and pressing the “Set As Destination” button. \n\nmo.Trader – Send aUEC to any player. Party members will be pinned to the top of the selection list.\n\nContracts Manager – View, accept, and manage contracts. The Contracts Manager is divided into the following tabs: General, Personal, Accepted, and History.\n• The General Tab displays local contracts certified to meet UEE and local law requirements. \n• The Personal Tab displays contracts sent specifically to your account, often from unknown sources that may violate local laws.\n• Once you accept an offer, contracts are moved to the Accepted Tab, and once a contract ends, either through successful completion or by other means, a record of it is kept in the History Tab.\n\nVehicle Maintenance Services – Repair, restock, and refuel your vehicles.\n\nJournal – A record of useful information and documents, including tutorial information.\n\nDelphi – Track your reputation with individual organizations or contacts.\n

NEW	Tut03_Part03_Journal01_TraversingtheVerse_Content=Congratulations!\n\nYou’ve completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the universe! \n\nNow it’s up to you decide what your life in space will be like. The Contract Manager on your mobiGlas contains many different opportunities for you to pursue from simple delivery missions to dangerous criminal jobs. Work hard and you can build your reputation with different organizations to gain access to more rewarding contracts. Whether you choose to live a life of crime or hunt down bounties and enforce the law, it is up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’d rather forge your own path, feel free to use the StarMap in the mobiGlas and explore all the Stanton system has to offer. From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. \n\nWherever your next steps take you, safe flying!

During the Alpha phase of Star Citizen’s development, we will be using a currency called aUEC (Alpha United Earth Credits). This is a temporary currency specifically designed for testing the in-game economy and balance.

These shuttles can take you all around Area18 – but your destination is the spaceport, where an Anvil C8 Pisces has been temporarily provided for you.\n\nThis snub scouting ship is a great starter vessel, perfect for new pilots looking to get their wings.

Anything they’re going those lengths to hide’s got to be worth something, right? That’s why we’re shelling out primo creds to anyone willing to breach the facility, snag the confidential materials, and drop them off at ~mission(dropoff1|address) for us.\n\nGonna be honest with you, part of why we’re not doing this one ourselves is it’s probably gonna be a mess. See, the confidential materials arrived alongside other boxes in a consignment now stored in their automated vault and the retrieval codes for that are only generated on-site. That means no remote hacking. Our source claims senior staff carry datapads with the codes on it, so you’ll have to liberate datapads off them before using the codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nBut the gig’s got some perks. The consignment includes other crates that we don’t really give a crap about that are probably worth something too. \n\nSo what do you say?\n\n- Bit Zeros \n

As they just received a delivery of confidential materials, we don’t believe this is a coincidence. BlacJac needs someone to hurry to the location and secure these important boxes before the Nine Tails do. You are authorized to use lethal force against any who attempt to stop you. \n\nAs part of our standard security protocol, the confidential materials were integrated into another consignment and secured in the automated vault. You’ll need to find the relevant retrieval codes for the consignment and enter it at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Retrieval codes are stored locally on datapads and only given to high-ranking staff, so you’ll have to locate them first. Hopefully they’re alive to help you, but considering the complete comms blackout, we fear that’s not the case.  \n\nOnce you’ve gathered all the confidential materials, they will need to be delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). Payment is contingent upon their delivery.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

BlacJac is looking to have you go to the site and assist in eliminating this threat.\n\nAnd since you’re already on thin ice as is, I don’t want to hear that you were involved in any friendly fire incidents.\n\nIf you’re able to pull this operation off, we can see about getting you reinstated.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n

NEW	ea_popup_body_ModeDisclaimer=This is an 'Experimental Mode' where new features, mechanics, and modified existing game modes are tested. The purpose of this mode is to provide regular rotating content to Arena Commander and collect feedback to improve and adjust gameplay ahead of its release to the Persistent Universe.
NEW	ea_popup_body_ModeDisclaimer_MasterModes=This game mode is a special limited test used to collect feedback on several new features being developed for Star Citizen's flight model. It is not representative of the current Persistent Universe or intended final version of the game. You can view full details on the Spectrum link below.\n \nNew Features:\nMaster Modes - a new flight system which introduces two modes for combat and navigation: SCM & NAV.\nGunnery v2 - a collection of gunnery and targeting changes such as weapon tuning, gimbal mode effects, auto-targeting functionality, new UI, and the removal of gimbal size limitations.\nTargeting v2 – new holographic UI and bindings including the addition of auto-targeting.\n \nFor this test you will be piloting a specially outfitted Gladius with 2 x S3 Gimbaled Laser Repeaters and a S3 Ballistic Gatling. This Gladius’ loadout cannot be altered and has been tuned specifically for Master Modes with increased agility, boost and shield regen adjustments as well as the shield profile being changed to Front/Back. \n \nDefault Bindings: ~action(spaceship_movement|v_master_mode_cycle) to change Master Modes, ~action(spaceship_targeting|v_auto_targeting_enable_short) to enable Auto-Targeting\n

DIFF	fine_terminal_informationScreen_Info=\nHow are fines attributed to me?\nMost fines are issued directly by members of law enforcement, but some result from violations detected by ships and mobiGlas and automatically broadcast to the Emergency Communication Network (ECN) system.\n\n\nWhat sort of things can I get fined for?\nFor a complete list of finable offenses and misdemeanors applicable in your current jurisdiction, please consult your mobiGlas.\n\n\nWhy did I receive a fine for something legal elsewhere?\nCertain jurisdictions have different laws. You should always check the legality of your cargo when entering a new jurisdiction.\n\n\nMy ship was stolen, why am I still receiving fines?\nUnless you report your vehicle stolen to law enforcement (this can be easily done at an ASOP terminal), you are still considered the legal owner of the ship and are responsible for certain crimes perpetrated by it.\n\n\nWhy does the Escalated Fine cost more than the initial price?\nTo encourage prompt payment, the Office of Imperial Justice (OIJ) provides offenders a short period where newly acquired fines may be settled at a discounted initial rate. If payment is not made before this period expires, the fine escalates in both price and severity.\n\n\nWhat happens if I don’t pay my Escalated Fines?\nIf you accumulate enough unpaid escalated fines you will be issued a crimestat. The heavier your escalated fines, the faster this will happen. The OIJ strongly urges everyone to pay their fines regularly and on time.\n\n\nWhat if I receive a fine in error?\nIf you think you have received a fine in error, please contact the Issue Council. While mistakes are rare, we are trying to improve the system all the time and your feedback is welcome.\n

Our on-site forces have suffered heavy casualties and stopped responding to comms. Initial reports indicated that the gang was attempting to obtain confidential material recently delivered to the facility. Thankfully, we have security measures in place that should give us time to respond. We need an operative to head to the facility immediately, retrieve those boxes, and deliver them to a secure location.\n\nYou and whatever backup you choose to bring are authorized to take any actions necessary when confronting the trespassers. Suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Hurston will not provide material support and/or updates regarding the status of the facility's security forces. \n\nThe confidential materials were discreetly delivered alongside other boxes in a consignment and locked in our automated vault. The retrieval codes needed to access them are kept on datapads held by senior security staff. Find those datapads and then enter the consignment codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Payment will be sent once all confidential materials have been delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). \n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

I’ve just learned of a battle near ~mission(Location) that’s just transpired far from the prying eyes of any meddlesome comm arrays, and reinforcements from either of the forces involved have yet to be dispatched. This means that there is a window of opportunity for an enterprising soul to pick the graveyard clean.\n \nI’d like to extend this opportunity to all my trusted contacts. Any and all interested parties can have the location… for the right price. Coordinates will be provided once you accept the contract and will remain available until you choose to terminate it.\n\nOf course, speed will be of the essence as you will not only face potential competition from other salvagers, but also the looming possibility of reinforcements arriving to survey the battlefield. \n\nIf you’re still hesitating, just remember, fortune favors the bold.\n\n-cd

NEW	mg_pacheco_DestroyEvidence_desc_001=It turns out that security over at ~mission(location|address) got their hands on a box of evidence that shouldn’t exist. I’m gonna pay you to destroy it for me.\n\nGetting to the evidence won’t be a walk in the park. You’ll have to make it past the station’s heavy security, and then take out the Chief of Security in order to get their access code to the Evidence Storage Unit. And even that’s not straightforward since the Chief only deals with high-level emergencies so I’m thinking you’ll have to shoot up the place pretty good before they feel it’s worth showing up. Bringing a crew with you is probably a good idea.\n\nOnce the Evidence Inventory System is started up, the box I want should be easy to find - it's blue and has "EVIDENCE" written on it. Destroy that and I’ll get you paid.\n\nWhat you do after that is up to you. There’s probably plenty of other valuable crap locked up in the Evidence Storage if you’re willing to hang around long enough to grab it, but that’s on you.\n\n-Twitch\n

NEW	mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_001=Long story short, one of my people got pinched with some evidence that could make things very uncomfortable for me and some of my associates. That’s why I want you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal it for me.\n\nIt won’t be easy. Not only is the station crawling with security, but the access code to activate the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. In order to get to them, you’ll need to create enough havoc to force the Chief to come deal with you in person. I usually don’t like loud and messy, but this job calls for it. It wouldn't be a bad idea to bring a crew along to help.\n\nOn the bright side, the evidence I want should be easy to spot. The box is blue and says "EVIDENCE" on the side. Anything else you want to take from storage and sell is fine with me as long as you remember that I’m your priority. \n\nOnce you have my evidence, drop it off at ~mission(destination|address) and we can call it a day.\n\n-Twitch\n
NEW	mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_002=I'll spare you the details, but I need a bit of leverage in a tricky negotiation and know exactly where to get it. That’s why I’m sending you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal a box of evidence for me.\n \nNow, I won’t lie to you. The job’s a toughy. The station is thick with security and the only access code to the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. To make things worse, that snotty bastard doesn’t like to get their hands dirty unless it’s a full-blown emergency which means that you’ll have to escalate things before the Chief will even bother coming round.\n\nOnce you do activate the Evidence Inventory System, the box I want should be the first one out. Now, there might be more boxes coming out after it, you can consider those your bonus payment. \n\nJust be sure that you take care of dropping off my evidence at ~mission(destination|address) first and foremost.\n\n-Twitch\n

NEW	mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Oh hello, I recently overheard a little bit of intel that ~mission(location|address) received some confidential materials that are of great interest to an acquaintance of mine. So interesting that they’re willing to pay for someone to storm the facility, grab the goods, and deliver them to ~mission(dropoff|address). Now I expect there to be plenty of security, who will most likely put up a fight, so I’d bring a gun or two. \n\nWord is the confidential materials were delivered in a consignment alongside other stuff and are now being stored in the facility’s automated vault. Senior security officers on-site carry datapads containing retrieval codes used to access the vault. You’ll have to get your hands on a datapad before using the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nIf you need a little sweetener, I’ve seen the manifest and can confirm that the other crates being stored at the facility are pretty choice. My client could care less about what happens to them, so they’re yours to do as you please. Run this right and those extra crates could be a nice bonus on top of the delivery fee for you.

NEW	mg_ruto_clearcrimestat_norep_desc_01=Hi there. We haven’t had a chance to work together yet but I’m in a bit of a bind here and I could use another body. Not for nothing, of course. I’m all for a good quid pro quo.\n\nOne of my associates who was serving some time in Klescher was supposed to bring me a datachip, but then they went quiet. Now I’m assuming they’re dead, but here’s the deal: if you finish his job, I wipe your crimestat. Not bad, right?\n\nYour predecessor was apparently planning on using some old tunnels to make his escape. He made it sound like they weren't exactly the easiest thing to access, but I trust you can figure it out. I'm guessing you'll find his body somewhere in there and if we’re lucky, he'll still have the chip on him.\n\nOnce you get it, finish getting out however you can. Then get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. You might want to watch out for Hurston Security, though. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them. After I get the data and validate it, I’ll wipe your crimestat. \n\nThen you can go and enjoy your newfound freedom. If you do this right, maybe I’ll have more lucrative work for you down the line.

NEW	mg_ruto_clearcrimestat_rep_desc_01=Hey there. I heard you ended up in Klescher which is a real drag. But it might actually be a lucky day for both of us.\n\nLong story short, I had somebody sneaking a datachip out of the prison, but they never got back to me. I know for a fact they haven’t left the facility, so I think something might have happened to them. While tragic, business must carry on. If you can get the chip and finish the job, I can clear your crimestat for you. What do you say?\n\nOf course, I don't know exactly how far they got, but I can tell you that the prison's got a whole network of hidden tunnels my guy was planning on using to make his escape. My guess is his corpse is rotting away somewhere there.\n\nOnce you find the body, I’m hoping the chip will still be on him. When you’ve got it, finish escaping and get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. \n\nOne warning though, you might want to watch out for Hurston Security. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them.\n\nWhen I've got the data I’ll wipe your crimestat and then, voila, you’ll be free and clear.

NEW	mg_ruto_collect_reclaimer_desc=Hey there. \n\nNine Tails got themselves a little problem. As it turns out, they got a little side biz in the underground organ trade. Now that an area I generally like to steer well clear of, but a gig’s a gig, right? It seems that one of their mobile butcher shops aboard the 'October Rising' got pinched by private security while out chopping. Now the Nine Tails are willing to cut ties with the ship and its crew (who are probably all dead anyway), but they need a particular crate extracted. Guess it was a special order or something.\n\nAnyway, get aboard the October Rising, get the package, and get out.\n\nSecurity’s still hanging around so watch yourself and maybe bring some friends, but remember, your priority is the package. If you're looking to save yourself some extra hassle, you could also black out the area by shutting down the nearest comm array if you want to avoid the crimestats for, you know, killing a bunch of a security. But hey, you do you.\n\nOnce you’re out, drop the package off at the clinic on Grim HEX and I’ll sort your payment.\n\nEasy peasy,\n\nRuto

One little mistake in a monitored zone and you got security whacks crawling all over you. \n\nSure, you could lay low 'til the heat is off, but you’re in luck ’cause I know a little fix to improve just about any crimestat situation.\n\nAll you need to do is head to Security Post Kareah and find a terminal hooked into the Imperial Criminal Database. It's not exactly the easiest station to get into since Crusader Security started using it as an evidence lock up and there's officers crawling all over the place, but beggars can’t be choosers, right?\n\nJust grab a cryptokey (Technotics in Grim HEX might be able to set you up), sneak or fight your way into Kareah, hack the criminal database, and just like that, no more crimestat ratings. I'm sure it sounds easier than it actually is.\n  \nOf course, you're welcomed to go get some rehab instead.\n\n-Ruto\n

NEW	mtps_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ABOUT THE JOB\nmicroTech Protection Services need a security professional for a retrieval op at ~mission(Location). The location is currently under attack and security forces on-site are unresponsive and presumed dead. We believe confidential materials recently delivered to the facility for temporary holding were the target of the raid. Your main focus will be collecting those boxes and delivering them to a secure location.  \n\nFor security reasons, the confidential materials were delivered as part of a larger shipment and secured in the automated vault. The materials have unique retrieval codes that must be entered on the keypad at the package conveyor. Protocols require that only senior security officers can carry a datapad containing a code, so you’ll have to locate them before retrieving the boxes. Once secured, deliver all of the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1) for payment.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n• Provide own transportation to ~mission(Location|address).\n• Use force as necessary to collect the confidential materials.\n• Deliver the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1|address).\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS\n• 2 years of combined mercenary and/or security experience.\n• Access to combat equipment. \n• Access to a spaceship that can transport cargo.\n• Available for immediate deployment.\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n• Experience with rapid hostility de-escalation techniques.\n• Experience hauling important cargo.

NEW	shubin_claimsweep_desc_easy=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWe just received word that a Shubin contractor was chased off one of our claims by outlaws who are operating there illegally. Further complicating matters, they have set up a few orbital sentries to protect themselves while they mine. \n\nOur hope is to contract with a mercenary who can search for and destroy the sentries at ~mission(location). If you do encounter an illegal miner at the site, be mindful that it is common practice for these types to contact reinforcements for assistance. It might be better to neutralize them as quickly as possible before they can do so. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
NEW	shubin_claimsweep_desc_hard=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA local Stanton independent mining team was working ~mission(Location) as Shubin Interstellar contractors when a hostile force attacked and took over the site. We believe that the perpetrators are still at the claim using the equipment left behind to harvest the valuable ore there for themselves.\n\nAmong the equipment lost were a handful of orbital sentries that had unfortunately not yet been fully deployed at the time of the attack. Long range scans of the claim have led us to conclude that the outlaws have activated the orbital sentries and are using them to protect their illegal operations.\n\nTo reclaim the site, we are seeking contractors to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries, and clear the site of hostile miners. Efficiency is strongly recommended as there is a high risk they will call for reinforcements once they discover they’re being evicted. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
NEW	shubin_claimsweep_desc_intro=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nIt was recently discovered that a Shubin mining claim has been illegally poached by a rogue miner. While the miner themselves seems to no longer be stealing ore from the site, they did leave behind an orbital sentry which is preventing us from reclaiming it thanks to its offensive capabilities.\n\nWe are looking for a mercenary willing to travel to ~mission(location) hunt down the sentry and destroy it in preparation for Shubin repossession of the site.\n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
NEW	shubin_claimsweep_desc_med=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA recently acquired Shubin Interstellar mining claim awaiting processing was discovered to have been jumped by a rogue mining outfit who are actively stealing ore from the site.  While local authorities have been notified, there is concern that valuable assets may be harvested before an official investigation can be launched.\n\nTherefore, as is our right as claim holders, we wish to secure a mercenary force to go to ~mission(Location) and destroy the several orbital sentries that are protecting this illegal operation. Caution is advised as there may still be a few illegal miners at the location along with any reinforcements they muster. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
NEW	shubin_claimsweep_desc_rand=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWhile conducting a survey of Shubin claims in the sector, we were disheartened to learn that a small team of outlaws have set up shop at ~mission(Location) and have been illegal harvesting resources. Worse, they have established a defensive perimeter with several orbital sentries dotted around the site making it difficult for us to evict them. \n\nIn order that we may repossess the claim site, we are seeking mercenary contractors to find and destroy the handful of orbital sentries. Adding additional difficulty to the task is that we are unclear as to the exact fighting strength of these outlaw miners. If they are given the chance to summon reinforcements expect anything from a small contingency to a full squad of trained fighters. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n

DIFF	ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_history=Aeroview proudly claims to be the oldest established hangar manufacturer in Human space. Their design and construction of hangars goes back more than 300 years. In the 27th century, Arthur Nassir formed the company around a rigid code of business ethics focusing largely on design quality, a dedication to ergonomics, and an extreme respect for client confidentiality. Aeroview also famously reserves the right to refuse service to any non-Citizens. While hangar design and housing is tangential, at best, to piracy, Nassir’s outspoken contempt for those who fly outside the law led to the company’s code. When Aeroview was purchased by Shubin Interstellar, the conditions of the sale insisted that the code be adhered to in perpetuity. /n/nWhile the code remains intact, Aeroview’s original business model does not. The Aeroview hangars of the 28th century were palatial affairs built on a case-by-case basis to the specifications of the social elite capable of owning their own spacecraft. In recent years, Aeroview has adapted their tactics to follow in SELF-LAND’s footsteps (although they would never admit it). Instead of custom-building high-class hangars on an individual basis, they now produce a line of modular “business hangars” priced to sell to successful businessmen and other executive-level clients. Unlike other modular hangar companies, Aeroview does not lease the property on which their hangars are established. This is left up to the individual consumer to determine; the Aeroview hangar can be erected at any point in the UEE given 48-hours notification (24 hours, for a steep rush construction fee). Of special note, Aeroview has found particular success in developing hangars for larger scale craft or craft that require additional space for support equipment. Pilots of ships like Freelancers, with multiple crew housings, or Hornets, with weapons racks and a need for more intensive hull repair facilities, generally find it more cost effective to purchase a single Aeroview hangar rather than multiple SELF-LANDs.
DIFF	ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_history=When the Revel & York engineering corporation set about designing its first hangar some thirty years ago, the reaction was laughter. The company, known best for excessively expensive and visibly uncomfortable furniture, was entering a field dominated by aerospace giants. The laughter ceased quickly as the Revel & York “deluxe” line of hangars became the de-facto spacecraft garage of the rich and powerful. The company’s cavernous hangars, established on ideal landing spaces in top-dollar land agreements, earned their standing reputation for excellence and quality. /n/nRevel & York designers work directly with pilots to develop a hangar experience like no other. R&Y is the only company currently constructing modular hangars designed to support merchantman-class spacecraft like the Constellation and Caterpillar, locking them into a valuable if small segment of the population. Their hangar designs have earned their reputation: between interlocking catwalks (with motorized lifts!) to allow pilots to supervise their spacecraft from overhead, to specially designed Greycat PV buggies for transporting ship crews from module to module, everything is designed for not just the elite pilots’ usability but also their overall enjoyment. SELF-LAND and competitors make a place to put your ship; Revel & York makes a place for you to take it in.
